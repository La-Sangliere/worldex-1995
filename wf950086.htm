                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Notwithstanding its serious ongoing economic problems, Gabon enjoys a per 
    capita income more than twice that of most nations of sub-Saharan Africa. 
    Gabon depended on timber and manganese until oil was discovered offshore in 
    the early 1970s. The oil sector now accounts for 50% of GDP. Real growth was
 
    feeble in 1992 and Gabon continues to face the problem of fluctuating prices
 


    for its oil, timber, manganese, and uranium exports. Despite an abundance of
 
    natural wealth, and a manageable rate of population growth, the economy is 
    hobbled by poor fiscal management. In 1992, the fiscal deficit widened to 
    2.4% of GDP, and Gabon failed to settle arrears on its bilateral debt, 
    leading to a cancellation of rescheduling agreements with official and 
    private creditors. Devaluation of its Francophone currency by 50% in January
 
    1994 did not set off an expected inflationary spiral but the government must
 
    continue to keep a tight reign on spending and wage increases.
