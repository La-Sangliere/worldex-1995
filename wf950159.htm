                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Mexico, under the guidance of new President Ernesto ZEDILLO, entered 1995 in
 
    the midst of a severe financial crisis. Mexico's membership in the North 
    American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with the United States and Canada, its
 
    solid record of economic reforms, and its strong growth in the second and 
    third quarters of 1994 - at an annual rate of 3.8% and 4.5% respectively - 
    seemed to augur bright prospects for 1995. However, an overvalued exchange 
    rate and widening current account deficits created an imbalance that 
    ultimately proved unsustainable. To finance the trade gap, Mexico City had 
    become increasingly reliant on volatile portfolio investment. A series of 
    political shocks in 1994 - an uprising in the southern state of Chiapas, the
 
    assassination of a presidential candidate, several high profile kidnappings,
 
    the killing of a second high-level political figure, and renewed threats 
    from the Chiapas rebels - combined with rising international interest rates 
    and concerns of a devaluation to undermine investor confidence and prompt 
    massive outflows of capital. The dwindling of foreign exchange reserves, 
    which the central bank had been using to defend the currency, forced the new
 
    administration to change the exchange rate policy and allow the currency to 
    float freely in the last days of 1994. The adjustment roiled Mexican 
    financial markets, leading to a 30% to 40% weakening of the peso relative to
 
    the dollar. ZEDILLO announced an emergency economic program that included 
    federal budget cuts and plans for more privatizations, but it failed to 


    restore investor confidence quickly. While the devaluation is likely to help
 
    Mexican exporters, whose products are now cheaper, it also raises the 
    specter of an inflationary spiral if domestic producers increase their 
    prices and workers demand wage hikes. Although strong economic fundamentals 
    bode well for Mexico's longer-term outlook, prospects for solid growth and 
    low inflation have deteriorated considerably, at least through 1995.
