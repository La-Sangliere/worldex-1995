Overview: 
    Economic activity consists primarily of subsistence farming and fishing. The
 
    islands have few mineral deposits worth exploiting, except for high-grade 
    phosphate. The potential for a tourist industry exists, but the remoteness 
    of the location and a lack of adequate facilities hinder development. 
    Financial assistance from the US is the primary source of revenue, with the 
    US pledged to spend $1 billion in the islands in the 1990s. Geographical 
    isolation and a poorly developed infrastructure are major impediments to 
    long-term growth.
