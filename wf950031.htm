                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    With its long history of semifeudal social controls, dependence on volatile 
    prices for its mineral exports, and bouts of hyperinflation, Bolivia has 
    remained one of the poorest and least developed Latin American countries. 
    However, Bolivia has experienced generally improving economic conditions 
    since the PAZ Estenssoro administration (1985-89) introduced market-oriented
 
    policies which reduced inflation from 11,700% in 1985 to about 20% in 1988. 
    PAZ Estenssoro was followed as President by Jaime PAZ Zamora (1989-93) who 
    continued the free-market policies of his predecessor, despite opposition 
    from his own party and from Bolivia's once powerful labor movement. By 
    maintaining fiscal discipline, PAZ Zamora helped reduce inflation to 9.3% in
 
    1993, while GDP grew by an annual average of 3.25% during his tenure. 
    Inaugurated in August 1993, President SANCHEZ DE LOZADA has vowed to advance
 
    the market-oriented economic reforms he helped launch as PAZ Estenssoro's 
    planning minister. His successes so far have included an inflation rate that
 
    continues to decrease - the 1994 rate of 8.5% was the lowest in ten years - 
    the signing of a free trade agreement with Mexico, and progress on his 


    unique privatization plan. The main privatization bill was passed by the 
    Bolivian legislature in late March 1994. Related laws - one that establishes
 
    SIRESE, the regulatory agency that will oversee the privatizations, and 
    another that outlines the rules for privatization in the electricity sector 
    - were approved later in the year.
