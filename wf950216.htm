                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    In 1994 macroeconomic performance improved steadily but privatization 
    progressed only in fits and starts. Most of Slovakia's IMF-approved targets 
    were met by an interim government that lasted 9 months. Annual inflation 
    fell from 23% in 1993 to 12%; unemployment at 14.6% was still well below 
    forecasts of 17%; and the budget deficit was around half that in 1993. 
    Slovakia's nearly $200 million trade surplus also compares favorably with a 
    more than $800 million deficit in 1993. Furthermore, after contracting 
    almost 25% in the three years following 1990, GDP grew 4.3% in 1994, 
    according to official statistics. Bratislava in June qualified for a $254 
    million IMF stand-by loan and the second $90 million tranche of its Systemic
 


    Transformation Facility and, in December, received approval for a European 
    Union loan worth about $160 million. By the end of September 1994, the 
    Central Bank's foreign currency reserves had tripled since the end of 1993. 
    Slovakia continued to have difficulty attracting foreign investment, 
    however, because of perceived political instability and halting progress in 
    privatization. The interim government prepared property worth nearly $2 
    billion for the second wave of coupon privatization and sold participation 
    in the program to over 80% of Slovakia's eligible citizens. Parties 
    controlling the new Parliament in November 1994, however, put the second 
    wave of coupon privatization on hold and suspended sales of 38 firms until 
    the new government could evaluate the interim government's decisions in 
    early 1995. The new government's targets for 1995 include GDP growth of 3%, 
    inflation of 8%-10%, unemployment of 15%, and a budget deficit under 3% of 
    GDP. Continuing economic recovery in western Europe should boost Slovak 
    exports and production, but Slovakia's image with foreign creditors and 
    investors could suffer setbacks in 1995 if progress on privatization stalls 
    or budget deficits mount beyond IMF-recommended levels.
