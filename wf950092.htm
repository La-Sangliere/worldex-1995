Overview: 
    Gibraltar benefits from an extensive shipping trade and offshore banking. 
    The British military presence has been severely reduced and now only

    for 15% of GDP; tourism, shipping services fees, and duties on consumer 
    goods also generate revenue. Because more than 70% of the economy is in the 
    public sector, changes in government spending have a major impact on the 
    level of employment.
