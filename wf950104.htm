                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    About 75% of the population live in abject poverty. Agriculture is mainly 
    small-scale subsistence farming and employs two-thirds of the work force. 
    The majority of the population does not have ready access to safe drinking 
    water, adequate medical care, or sufficient food. The lack of employment 
    opportunities remains one of the most critical problems facing the economy, 
    along with soil erosion and political instability. International trade 
    sanctions in response to the September 1991 coup against President ARISTIDE 
    further damaged the economy. The restoration of President ARISTIDE, the 
    lifting of sanctions in late 1994, and foreign aid will alleviate some 
    economic problems. Haiti will continue to depend heavily on foreign aid.
