  conventional long form: 
    Republic of Peru 
  conventional short form: 
    Peru 
  local long form: 
    Republica del Peru 
  local short form: 
    Peru 
Digraph: 
    PE 
Type: 
    republic 
Capital: 
    Lima 
Administrative divisions: 
    24 departments (departamentos, singular - departamento) and 1 constitutional
 
    province* (provincia constitucional); Amazonas, Ancash, Apurimac, Arequipa, 
    Ayacucho, Cajamarca, Callao*, Cusco, Huancavelica, Huanuco, Ica, Junin, La 
    Libertad, Lambayeque, Lima, Loreto, Madre de Dios, Moquegua, Pasco, Piura, 
    Puno, San Martin, Tacna, Tumbes, Ucayali 
  note: 
    the 1979 Constitution mandated the creation of regions (regiones, singular -
 
    region) to function eventually as autonomous economic and administrative 
    entities; so far, 12 regions have been constituted from 23 of the 24 
    departments - Amazonas (from Loreto), Andres Avelino Caceres (from Huanuco, 
    Pasco, Junin), Arequipa (from Arequipa), Chavin (from Ancash), Grau (from 
    Tumbes, Piura), Inca (from Cusco, Madre de Dios, Apurimac), La Libertad 
    (from La Libertad), Los Libertadores-Huari (from Ica, Ayacucho, 
    Huancavelica), Mariategui (from Moquegua, Tacna, Puno), Nor Oriental del 
    Maranon (from Lambayeque, Cajamarca, Amazonas), San Martin (from San 


    Martin), Ucayali (from Ucayali); formation of another region has been 
    delayed by the reluctance of the constitutional province of Callao to merge 
    with the department of Lima; because of inadequate funding from the central 
    government and organizational and political difficulties, the regions have 
    yet to assume major responsibilities; the 1993 Constitution retains the 
    regions but limits their authority; the 1993 Constitution also reaffirms the
 
    roles of departmental and municipal governments.

                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    The Peruvian economy has become increasingly market-oriented, with major 
    privatizations completed in 1994 in the mining and telecommunications 
    industries. In the 1980s the economy suffered from hyperinflation, declining
 
    per capita output, and mounting external debt. Peru was shut off from IMF 
    and World Bank support in the mid-1980s because of its huge debt arrears. An
 
    austerity program implemented shortly after the FUJIMORI government took 
    office in July 1990 contributed to a third consecutive yearly contraction of
 
    economic activity, but the slide came to a halt late that year, and in 1991 
    output rose 2.4%. After a burst of inflation as the austerity program 
    eliminated government price subsidies, monthly price increases eased to the 
    single-digit level and by December 1991 dropped to the lowest increase since
 
    mid-1987. Lima obtained a financial rescue package from multilateral lenders
 
    in September 1991, although it faced $14 billion in arrears on its external 
    debt. By working with the IMF and World Bank on new financial conditions and
 
    arrangements, the government succeeded in ending its arrears by March 1993. 


    In 1992, GDP had fallen by 2.8%, in part because a warmer-than-usual El Nino
 
    current resulted in a 30% drop in the fish catch, but the economy rebounded 
    as strong foreign investment helped push growth to 6% in 1993 and 8.6% in 
    1994.
