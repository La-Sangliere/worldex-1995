                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Bolstered by a widespread national desire to reintegrate into Western 
    Europe, the Estonian government has pursued an ambitious program of market 
    reforms and stabilization measures, which is rapidly transforming the 
    economy. Three years after independence - and two years after the 
    introduction of the kroon - Estonians are beginning to reap tangible 
    benefits; inflation, though still high, was brought down to about 2% per 
    month in second half 1994; production declines have bottomed out with 
    estimated growth of 4% in 1994; and living standards are rising. Economic 
    restructuring has been dramatic. By 1994 the service sector accounted for 
    over 55% of GDP, while the once-dominant heavy industrial sector continues 
    to shrink. The private sector is growing rapidly; the share of the state 
    enterprises in the economy has steadily declined and by late 1994 accounted 
    for only about 40% of GDP. Estonia's foreign trade has shifted rapidly from 
    East to West; the Western industrialized countries now account for 
    two-thirds of foreign trade.
