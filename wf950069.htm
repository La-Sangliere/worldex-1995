                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    The Dominican economy showed some signs of slippage in 1994, although its 
    overall performance in recent years has been relatively strong. After 
    posting an increase of nearly 8% in 1992, GDP growth fell to 3% in 1993 and 
    1994 as mining output decreased and erosion of real wages caused private 
    consumption to decline. A pre-election boost in government spending in early
 
    1994 led to the first government deficit in four years and bumped inflation 
    up to 14% for the year. Continued dynamism in construction and the services 
    sector, especially tourism, should keep the economy growing in 1995. 
    Tourism, agriculture, and manufacturing for export remain key sectors of the
 
    economy. Domestic industry is based on the processing of agricultural 
    products, oil refining, and chemicals.
