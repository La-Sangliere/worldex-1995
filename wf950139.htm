                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Small, landlocked, and mountainous, Lesotho has no important natural 
    resources other than water. Its economy is based on agriculture, light 
    manufacturing, and remittances from laborers employed in South Africa (these
 
    remittances supplement domestic income by as much as 45%). The great 
    majority of households gain their livelihoods from subsistence farming and 
    migrant labor; a large portion of the adult male work force is employed in 
    South African mines. Manufacturing depends largely on farm products to 
    support the milling, canning, leather, and jute industries; other industries
 
    include textile, clothing, and construction. Although drought has decreased 
    agricultural activity over the past few years, improvement of a major 
    hydropower facility will permit the sale of water to South Africa and allow 
    Lesotho's economy to continue its moderate growth.
