                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    This small private enterprise economy has capitalized on its central 
    geographic location, highly developed transport network, and diversified 
    industrial and commercial base. Industry is concentrated mainly in the 
    populous Flemish area in the north, although the government is encouraging 
    reinvestment in the southern region of Walloon. With few natural resources 
    Belgium must import substantial quantities of raw materials and export a 
    large volume of manufactures, making its economy unusually dependent on the 
    state of world markets. Three-fourths of its trade is with other EU 
    countries. The economy grew at a strong 4% pace during the period 1988-90, 
    slowed to 1% in 1991-92, dropped by 1.5% in 1993, and recovered with 2.3% 
    growth in 1994. Belgium's public debt has risen to 140% of GDP, and the 
    government is trying to control its expenditures to bring the figure more 
    into line with other industrialized countries.
