Note: 
    Azerbaijan continues to be plagued by an unresolved seven-year-old conflict 
    with Armenian separatists over its Nagorno-Karabakh region. The Karabakh 
    Armenians have declared independence and seized almost 20% of the country's 
    territory, creating almost 1 million Azeri displaced persons in the process.
 
    Both sides have generally observed a Russian-mediated cease-fire in place 
    since May 1994, and support the OSCE-mediated peace process, now entering 
    its fourth year. Nevertheless, Baku and Xankandi (Stepanakert) remain far 
    apart on most substantive issues from the placement and composition of a 
    peacekeeping force to the enclave's ultimate political status, and prospects
 
    for a negotiated settlement remain dim. 
 
                                    Geography 
 
Location: 
    Southwestern Asia, bordering the Caspian Sea, between Iran and Russia 


Map references: 
    Commonwealth of Independent States - European States 
Area: 
  total area: 
    86,600 sq km 
  land area: 
    86,100 sq km 
  comparative area: 
    slightly larger than Maine 
  note: 
    includes the exclave of Naxcivan Autonomous Republic and the 
    Nagorno-Karabakh region; the region's autonomy was abolished by Azerbaijani 
    Supreme Soviet on 26 November 1991 
Land boundaries: 
    total 2,013 km, Armenia (west) 566 km, Armenia (southwest) 221 km, Georgia 
    322 km, Iran (south) 432 km, Iran (southwest) 179 km, Russia 284 km, Turkey 
    9 km 
Coastline: 
    0 km (landlocked) 
  note: 
    Azerbaijan borders the Caspian Sea (800 km, est.) 
Maritime claims: 
    none; landlocked 
International disputes: 
    violent and longstanding dispute with ethnic Armenians of Nagorno-Karabakh 
    over its status; Caspian Sea boundaries are not yet determined 
Climate: 
    dry, semiarid steppe 
Terrain: 
    large, flat Kur-Araz Lowland (much of it below sea level) with Great 
    Caucasus Mountains to the north, Qarabag (Karabakh) Upland in west; Baku 
    lies on Abseron (Apsheron) Peninsula that juts into Caspian Sea 
Natural resources: 
    petroleum, natural gas, iron ore, nonferrous metals, alumina

  current issues: 
    local scientists consider the Abseron (Apsheron) Peninsula (including Baku 
    and Sumqayit) and the Caspian Sea to be the ecologically most devastated 
    area in the world because of severe air, water, and soil pollution; soil 
    pollution results from the use of DDT as a pesticide and also from toxic 
    defoliants used in the production of cotton 
  natural hazards: 
    droughts; some lowland areas threatened by rising levels of the Caspian Sea 
 
                                    Geography

                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Azerbaijan is less developed industrially than either Armenia or Georgia, 
    the other Transcaucasian states. It resembles the Central Asian states in 
    its majority nominally Muslim population, high structural unemployment, and 
    low standard of living. The economy's most prominent products are oil, 
    cotton, and gas. Production from the Caspian oil and gas field has been in 
    decline for several years, but the November 1994 ratification of the $7.5 
    billion oil deal with a consortium of Western companies should generate the 
    funds needed to spur future industrial development. Azerbaijan accounted for
 
    1.5% to 2% of the capital stock and output of the former Soviet Union. 
    Azerbaijan shares all the formidable problems of the ex-Soviet republics in 
    making the transition from a command to a market economy, but its 
    considerable energy resources brighten its long-term prospects. Baku has 
    only recently begun making progress on economic reform, and old economic 
    ties and structures have yet to be replaced.
