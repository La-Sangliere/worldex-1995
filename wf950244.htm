    beachhead erosion because of the use of sand for building materials; 
    excessive clearance of forest undergrowth for use as fuel; damage to coral 
    reefs from the spread of the crown of thorns starfish

                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Tuvalu consists of a scattered group of nine coral atolls with poor soil. 
    The country has no known mineral resources and few exports. Subsistence 
    farming and fishing are the primary economic activities. The islands are too
 
    small and too remote for development of a tourist industry. Government 
    revenues largely come from the sale of stamps and coins and worker 
    remittances. Substantial income is received annually from an international 
    trust fund established in 1987 by Australia, NZ, and the UK and supported 
    also by Japan and South Korea.
