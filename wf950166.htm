                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Morocco faces the typical problems of developing countries - restraining 
    government spending, reducing constraints on private activity and foreign 
    trade, and keeping inflation within bounds. Since the early 1980s the 
    government has pursued an economic program toward these objectives with the 
    support of the IMF, the World Bank, and the Paris Club of creditors. The 
    economy has substantial assets to draw on: the world's largest phosphate 
    reserves, diverse agricultural and fishing resources, a sizable tourist 
    industry, a growing manufacturing sector, and remittances from Moroccans 
    working abroad. A severe drought in 1992-93 depressed economic activity and 
    held down exports. Real GDP contracted by 4.4% in 1992 and 1.1% in 1993. 
    Despite these setbacks, initiatives to relax capital controls, strengthen 
    the banking sector, and privatize state enterprises went forward in 1993-94.
 
    Favorable rainfall in 1994 boosted agricultural production by 40%. Servicing
 
    the large debt, high unemployment, and vulnerability to external economic 
    forces remain long-term problems for Morocco.
