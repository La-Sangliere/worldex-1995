                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Latvia is rapidly becoming a dynamic market economy, rivaled only by Estonia
 
    among the former Soviet states in the speed of its transformation. However, 
    the transition has been painful; in 1994 the IMF reported a 2% growth in 
    GDP, following steep declines in 1992-93. The government's tough monetary 
    policies and reform program have kept inflation at less than 2% a month, 
    supported a dynamic private sector now accounting for more than half of GDP,
 
    and spurred the growth of trade ties with the West. Much of agriculture is 
    already privatized and the government plans to step up the pace of 
    privatization of state enterprises. Latvia thus is in the midst of recovery,
 
    helped by the country's strategic location on the Baltic Sea, its 
    well-educated population, and its diverse - albeit largely obsolete - 
    industrial structure.
