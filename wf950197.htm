                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Puerto Rico has one of the most dynamic economies in the Caribbean region. 
    Industry has surpassed agriculture as the primary sector of economic 
    activity and income. Encouraged by duty free access to the US and by tax 
    incentives, US firms have invested heavily in Puerto Rico since the 1950s. 
    US minimum wage laws apply. Important industries include pharmaceuticals, 
    electronics, textiles, petrochemicals, and processed foods. Sugar production
 
    has lost out to dairy production and other livestock products as the main 
    source of income in the agricultural sector. Tourism has traditionally been 
    an important source of income for the island, with estimated arrivals of 
    nearly 3.9 million tourists in 1993.
