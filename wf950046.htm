                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Cape Verde's low per capita GDP reflects a poor natural resource base, 
    serious water shortages exacerbated by cycles of long-term drought, and a 
    high birthrate. The economy is service oriented, with commerce, transport, 
    and public services accounting for 60% of GDP. Although nearly 70% of the 
    population lives in rural areas, agriculture's share of GDP is only 20%; the
 
    fishing sector accounts for 4%. About 90% of food must be imported. The 
    fishing potential, mostly lobster and tuna, is not fully exploited. Cape 
    Verde annually runs a high trade deficit, financed by remittances from 
    emigrants and foreign aid, which form important supplements to GDP. Economic
 
    reforms, launched by the new democratic government in 1991, are aimed at 
    developing the private sector and attracting foreign investment to diversify
 
    the economy. Prospects for 1995 depend heavily on the maintenance of aid 
    flows, remittances, and the momentum of the government's development 
    program.
