Overview: 
    Coal mining is the major economic activity on Svalbard. By treaty (9 
    February 1920), the nationals of the treaty powers have equal rights to 
    exploit mineral deposits, subject to Norwegian regulation. Although US, UK, 
    Dutch, and Swedish coal companies have mined in the past, the only companies
 
    still mining are Norwegian and Russian. The settlements on Svalbard are 
    essentially company towns. The Norwegian state-owned coal company employs 
    nearly 60% of the Norwegian population on the island, runs many of the local
 
    services, and provides most of the local infrastructure. There is also some 
    trapping of seal, polar bear, fox, and walrus.
