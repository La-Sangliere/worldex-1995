    proclaimed a government in exile of the Sahrawi Arab Democratic Republic 
    (SADR); territory partitioned between Morocco and Mauritania in April 1976, 
    with Morocco acquiring northern two-thirds; Mauritania, under pressure from 
    Polisario guerrillas, abandoned all claims to its portion in August 1979;

    asserted administrative control; the Polisario's government in exile was

Overview: 
    Western Sahara, a territory poor in natural resources and having little 
    rainfall, depends on pastoral nomadism, fishing, and phosphate mining as the
 
    principal sources of income for the population. Most of the food for the 
    urban population must be imported. All trade and other economic activities 
    are controlled by the Moroccan Government. Incomes and standards of living 
    are substantially below the Moroccan level.
