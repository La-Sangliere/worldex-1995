                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Aided by a long period of peace and neutrality during World War I through 
    World War II, Sweden has achieved an enviable standard of living under a 
    mixed system of high-tech capitalism and extensive welfare benefits. It has 
    a modern distribution system, excellent internal and external 
    communications, and a skilled labor force. Timber, hydropower, and iron ore 
    constitute the resource base of an economy that is heavily oriented toward 
    foreign trade. Privately owned firms account for about 90% of industrial 
    output, of which the engineering sector accounts for 50% of output and 
    exports. In 1990, agriculture accounted for only 1.2% of GDP and 1.9% of the
 
    jobs, Sweden being about 50% sufficient in most products. In the last few 
    years, however, this extraordinarily favorable picture has been clouded by 
    inflation, growing unemployment, and a gradual loss of competitiveness in 
    international markets. Although Prime Minister BILDT's center-right minority
 
    coalition had hoped to charge ahead with free-market-oriented reforms, a 
    skyrocketing budget deficit - about 14% of GDP in FY93/94 projections - and 
    record unemployment have forestalled many of the plans. Unemployment in 1994
 
    is estimated at around 9% with another 5% in job training. Continued heavy 
    foreign exchange speculation forced the government to cooperate in late 1992
 
    with the opposition Social Democrats on two crisis packages - one a severe 
    austerity pact and the other a program to spur industrial competitiveness - 
    which basically set economic policy through 1997. In November 1992, Sweden 
    broke its tie to the EC's ECU, and the krona has since depreciated about 25%
 
    against the dollar. The boost in export competitiveness from the 
    depreciation helped lift Sweden out of its 3-year recession. To curb the 
    budget deficit and bolster confidence in the economy, the new Social 
    Democratic government is proposing cuts in welfare benefits, subsidies, 
    defense, and foreign aid. Sweden has harmonized its economic policies with 
    those of the EU, which it joined at the start of 1995.
