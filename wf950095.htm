                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Greenland's economic situation at present is difficult. Unemployment is 
    increasing, and prospects for economic growth in the immediate future are 
    dim. Following the closing of the Black Angel lead and zinc mine in 1989, 
    Greenland became almost completely dependent on fishing and fish processing,
 
    the sector accounting for 95% of exports. Prospects for fisheries are not 
    bright, as the important shrimp catches will at best stabilize and cod 
    catches have dropped. Resumption of mining and hydrocarbon activities is not
 


    around the corner, thus leaving only tourism with some potential for the 
    near future. The public sector in Greenland, i.e., the central government 
    and its commercial entities and the municipalities, plays a dominant role in
 
    Greenland accounting for about two-thirds of total employment. About half 
    the government's revenues come from grants from the Danish Government.
