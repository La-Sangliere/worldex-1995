                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Before the dissolution of Yugoslavia, the republic of Croatia, after 
    Slovenia, was the most prosperous and industrialized area, with a per capita
 
    output perhaps one-third above the Yugoslav average. At present, Croatian 
    Serb Separatists control approximately one-third of the Croatian territory, 
    and one of the overriding determinants of Croatia's long-term political and 
    economic prospects will be the resolution of this territorial dispute. 
    Croatia faces serious economic problems stemming from: the legacy of 
    longtime Communist mismanagement of the economy; large foreign debt; damage 
    during the fighting to bridges, factories, power lines, buildings, and 
    houses; the large refugee population, both Croatian and Bosnian; and the 
    disruption of economic ties to Serbia and the other former Yugoslav 
    republics, as well as within its own territory. At the minimum, extensive 
    Western aid and investment, especially in the tourist and oil industries, 
    would seem necessary to revive the moribund economy. However, peace and 
    political stability must come first; only then will recent government moves 


    toward a "market-friendly" economy restore old levels of output. As of 
    February 1995, fighting continues among Croats, Serbs, and Muslims, and 
    national boundaries and final political arrangements are still in doubt.
