                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Cuba's heavily statist economy remains severely depressed as the result of 
    its own inefficiencies and the loss of massive amounts of economic aid from 
    the former Soviet Bloc. Total output in 1994 was only about half the output 
    of 1989. The fall in output and in imports is reflected in the deterioration
 
    of food supplies, shortages of electricity, inability to get spare parts, 
    and the replacement of motor-driven vehicles by bicycles and draft animals. 
    Higher world market prices for sugar and nickel in 1994, however, resulted 
    in a slight increase in export earnings for the first time in six years, 
    despite lower production of both commodities. The growth of tourism slowed 
    in late 1994 as a result of negative publicity surrounding the exodus of 
    Cubans from the island and other international factors. The government 
    continued its aggressive search for foreign investment and announced 
    preliminary agreements to form large joint ventures with Mexican investors 
    in telecommunications and oil refining. In mid-1994, the National Assembly 
    began introducing several new taxes and price increases to stem growing 
    excess liquidity and restore some of the peso's value as a monetary 
    instrument. In October the government attempted to stimulate food production
 
    by permitting the sale of any surplus production (over state quotas) at 
    unrestricted prices at designated markets. Similar but much smaller markets 
    were also introduced for the sale of manufactured goods in December. The 
    various government measures have influenced a remarkable appreciation of the
 
    black market value of the peso, from more than 100 pesos to the dollar in 
    September 1994 to 40 pesos to the dollar in early 1995. Policy discussions 
    continue in the bureaucracy over the proper pace and scope of economic 
    reform.
