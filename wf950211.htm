                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    In 1994 Senegal embarked on its most concerted structural adjustment effort 
    yet to exploit the 50% devaluation of the currencies of the 14 Francophone 
    African nations on 12 January. After years of foot-dragging, the government 
    finally passed a liberalized labor code which should significantly help 
    lower the cost of labor and improve the manufacturing sector's 
    competitiveness. Inroads also have been made in closing tax loopholes and 
    eliminating monopoly power in several sectors. At the same time the 
    government is holding the line on current fiscal expenditure under the 
    watchful eyes of international organizations on which it depends for 
    substantial support. A bumper peanut crop - Senegal's main source of foreign
 
    exchange - coincided with an improvement of international prices and 
    probably resulted in a doubling of earnings in 1994 over 1993. The country's
 
    narrow resource base, environmental degradation, and untamed population 
    growth will continue to hold back growth in living standards over the medium
 
    term.
