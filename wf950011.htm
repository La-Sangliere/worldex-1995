                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Argentina, rich in natural resources, benefits also from a highly literate 
    population, an export-oriented agricultural sector, and a diversified 
    industrial base. Nevertheless, following decades of mismanagement and 
    statist policies, the economy in the late 1980s was plagued with huge 
    external debts and recurring bouts of hyperinflation. Elected in 1989, in 
    the depths of recession, President MENEM has implemented a comprehensive 
    economic restructuring program that shows signs of putting Argentina on a 
    path of stable, sustainable growth. Argentina's currency has traded at par 
    with the US dollar since April 1991, and inflation has fallen to its lowest 
    level in 20 years. Argentines have responded to the relative price stability
 
    by repatriating flight capital and investing in domestic industry. The 
    economy registered an impressive 6% advance in 1994, fueled largely by 
    inflows of foreign capital and strong domestic consumption spending. The 
    government's major short term objective is encouraging exports, e.g., by 
    reducing domestic costs of production. At the start of 1995, the government 
    had to deal with the spillover from international financial movements 
    associated with the devaluation of the Mexican peso. In addition, 
    unemployment had become a serious issue for the government. Despite average 
    annual 7% growth in 1991-94, unemployment surprisingly has doubled - due 
    mostly to layoffs in government bureaus and in privatized industrial firms 
    and utilities and, to a lesser degree, to illegal immigration. Much remains 
    to be done in the 1990s in dismantling the old statist barriers to growth, 
    extending the recent economic gains, and bringing down the rate of 
    unemployment.
