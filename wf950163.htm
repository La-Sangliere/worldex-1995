Overview: 
    Monaco, situated on the French Mediterranean coast, is a popular resort, 
    attracting tourists to its casino and pleasant climate. The Principality has
 
    successfully sought to diversify into services and small, high-value-added, 
    nonpolluting industries. The state has no income tax and low business taxes 
    and thrives as a tax haven both for individuals who have established 
    residence and for foreign companies that have set up businesses and offices.
 


    About 50% of Monaco's annual revenue comes from value-added taxes on hotels,
 
    banks, and the industrial sector; about 25% of revenue comes from tourism. 
    Living standards are high, that is, roughly comparable to those in 
    prosperous French metropolitan suburbs.
