                                    Geography 
 
Location: 
    Central Asia, northwest of China

    Commonwealth of Independent States - Central Asian States 
Area: 
  total area: 
    2,717,300 sq km 
  land area: 
    2,669,800 sq km 
  comparative area: 
    slightly less than four times the size of Texas 
Land boundaries: 
    total 12,012 km, China 1,533 km, Kyrgyzstan 1,051 km, Russia 6,846 km, 
    Turkmenistan 379 km, Uzbekistan 2,203 km 
Coastline: 
    0 km (landlocked) 
  note: 
    Kazakhstan borders the Aral Sea (1,015 km) and the Caspian Sea (1,894 km) 
Maritime claims: 
    none; landlocked 
International disputes: 
    Caspian Sea boundaries are not yet determined 
Climate: 
    continental, cold winters and hot summers, arid and semiarid 
Terrain: 
    extends from the Volga to the Altai Mountains and from the plains in western
 
    Siberia to oasis and desert in Central Asia 
Natural resources: 
    major deposits of petroleum, coal, iron ore, manganese, chrome ore, nickel, 


    cobalt, copper, molybdenum, lead, zinc, bauxite, gold, uranium 
Land use: 
  arable land: 
    15% 
  permanent crops:

Irrigated land:

Environment: 
  current issues: 
    radioactive or toxic chemical sites associated with its former defense 
    industries and test ranges are found throughout the country and pose health 
    risks for humans and animals; industrial pollution is severe in some cities;
 
    because the two main rivers which flowed into the Aral Sea have been 
    diverted for irrigation, it is drying up and leaving behind a harmful layer 
    of chemical pesticides and natural salts; these substances are then picked 
    up by the wind and blown into noxious dust storms; pollution in the Caspian 
    Sea; soil pollution from overuse of agricultural chemicals and salinization 
    from faulty irrigation practices

    NA

                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Kazakhstan, the second largest of the former Soviet states in territory, 
    possesses enormous untapped fossil-fuel reserves as well as plentiful 
    supplies of other minerals and metals. It also has considerable agricultural
 
    potential with its vast steppe lands accommodating both livestock and grain 
    production. Kazakhstan's industrial sector rests on the extraction and 
    processing of these natural resources and also on a relatively large machine
 
    building sector specializing in construction equipment, tractors, 
    agricultural machinery, and some defense items. The breakup of the USSR and 
    the collapse of demand for Kazakhstan's traditional heavy industry products 
    have resulted in a sharp contraction of the economy since 1991, with the 
    steepest annual decline occurring in 1994. The government has pursued a 
    moderate program of economic reform and privatization which is gradually 
    lifting state controls over economic activity and shifting assets into the 
    private sector. Nevertheless, government control over key sectors of the 


    economy remains strong. Sustained economic hardships and continued pressures
 
    from industrial elites will make it difficult for the government to sustain 
    its policies of monetary and fiscal discipline which had brought down 
    inflation by the end of 1994. Continued lack of pipeline transportation for 
    expanded oil exports has closed off a likely source of economic recovery.
