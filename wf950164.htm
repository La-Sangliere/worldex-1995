                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Mongolia's severe climate, scattered population, and wide expanses of 
    unproductive land have constrained economic development. Economic activity 
    traditionally has been based on agriculture and the breeding of livestock. 
    In past years extensive mineral resources had been developed with Soviet 
    support; total Soviet assistance at its height amounted to 30% of GDP. The 
    mining and processing of coal, copper, molybdenum, tin, tungsten, and gold 
    account for a large part of industrial production. Timber and fishing are 
    also important sectors. The Mongolian leadership has been gradually making 
    the transition from Soviet-style central planning to a market economy 
    through privatization and price reform, and is soliciting support from 
    international financial agencies and foreign investors. The economy, 
    however, has still not recovered from the loss of Soviet aid, and the 
    country continues to suffer substantial economic hardships, with one-fourth 
    of the population below the poverty line.
