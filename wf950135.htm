                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 


    Kyrgyzstan is one of the smallest and poorest states of the former Soviet 
    Union. Its economy is heavily agricultural, growing cotton and tobacco on 
    irrigated land in the south and grain in the foothills of the north and 
    raising sheep and goats on mountain pastures. Its small and obsolescent 
    industrial sector, concentrated around Bishkek, has traditionally relied on 
    Russia and other CIS countries for customers and industrial inputs, 
    including most of its fuel. Since 1990, the economy has contracted by almost
 
    50% as subsidies from Moscow vanished and trade links with other former 
    Soviet republics eroded. At the same time, the Kyrgyz government stuck to 
    tight monetary and fiscal policies in 1994 that succeeded in reducing 
    inflation from 23% per month in 1993 to 5.4% per month in 1994. Moreover, 
    Kyrgyzstan has been the most successful of the Central Asian states in 
    reducing state controls over the economy and privatizing state industries. 
    Nevertheless, restructuring proved to be a slow and painful process in 1994 
    despite relatively large flows of foreign aid and continued progress on 
    economic reform. The decline in output in 1995 may be much smaller, perhaps 
    5%, compared with an estimated 24% in 1994.
