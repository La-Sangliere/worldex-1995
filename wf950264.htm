                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Prior to 1993 the economy had been in decline for more than a decade with 
    falling imports and growing foreign debt. Economic difficulties stemmed 
    largely from a chronically depressed level of copper production and weak 


    copper prices, generally ineffective economic policies, and high inflation. 
    An annual population growth of 3% brought a decline in per capita GDP of 50%
 
    over the decade. However, economic reforms enacted since 1992 have helped 
    reduce inflation, have begun to strengthen the social safety net, and have 
    been accompanied by GDP growth at an estimated 6.8% in 1993 and 4% in 1994. 
    The huge external debt remains a key problem.
