    to control the entry of third country nationals into the UAE portion of Abu

    diplomatic support for the UAE in the region, but in 1994 it increased its

                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Iran's economy is a mixture of central planning, state ownership of oil and 
    other large enterprises, village agriculture, and small-scale private 
    trading and service ventures. Over the past several years, the government 
    has introduced several measures to liberalize the economy and reduce 
    government intervention, but most of these changes have moved slowly because
 
    of political opposition. Iran has faced increasingly severe financial 
    difficulties since mid-1992 due to an import surge that began in 1989 and 
    general financial mismanagement. At yearend 1993 the Iranian Government 
    estimated that it owed foreign creditors about $30 billion; an estimated $8 
    billion of this debt was in arrears. At yearend 1994, Iran rescheduled $12 
    billion in debt. Earnings from oil exports - which provide 90% of Iran's 
    export revenues - are providing less relief to Iran than usual because of 
    reduced oil prices.
