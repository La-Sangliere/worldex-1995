                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Fiji's economy is primarily agricultural, with a large subsistence sector. 
    Sugar exports and tourism are the major sources of foreign exchange. 
    Industry contributes 13% to GDP, with sugar processing accounting for 
    one-third of industrial activity. Roughly 250,000 tourists visit each year. 
    Political uncertainty and drought, however, contribute to substantial 
    fluctuations in earnings from tourism and sugar and to the emigration of 


    skilled workers. In 1992, growth was approximately 3%, based on growth in 
    tourism and a lessening of labor-management disputes in the sugar and 
    gold-mining sectors. In 1993, the government's budgeted growth rate of 3% 
    was not achieved because of a decline in non-sugar agricultural output and 
    damage from Cyclone Kina. Growth in 1994 is estimated to be 5%, largely 
    attributed to increased tourism and expansion in domestic production, 
    particularly in the manufacturing sector.
