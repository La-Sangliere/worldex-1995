                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Guinea-Bissau ranks among the poorest countries in the world. Agriculture 
    and fishing are the main economic activities. Cashew nuts, peanuts, and palm
 
    kernels are the primary exports. Exploitation of known mineral deposits is 
    unlikely at present because of a weak infrastructure and the high cost of 
    development. With IMF support the country is committed to an economic reform
 
    program emphasizing monetary stability and private sector growth. This 
    process will continue at a slow pace because of a heavy foreign debt burden 
    and internal constraints.
