                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Iceland's Scandinavian-type economy is basically capitalistic, but with an 
    extensive welfare system, relatively low unemployment, and comparatively 
    even distribution of income. The economy is heavily dependent on the fishing
 
    industry, which provides nearly 75% of export earnings and employs 12% of 
    the work force. In the absence of other natural resources - except energy - 
    Iceland's economy is vulnerable to changing world fish prices. The economy, 
    in recession since 1988, began to recover in 1993, posting 0.4% growth, but 
    was still hampered by cutbacks in fish quotas as well as falling world 
    prices for its main exports: fish and fish products, aluminum, and 
    ferrosilicon. Real GDP grew by perhaps 2.4% in 1994. The center-right 
    government plans to continue its policies of reducing the budget and current
 
    account deficits, limiting foreign borrowing, containing inflation, revising
 
    agricultural and fishing policies, diversifying the economy, and privatizing
 
    state-owned industries. The government, however, remains divided on the 
    issue of EU membership, primarily because of Icelanders' concern about 
    losing control over their fishing resources.
