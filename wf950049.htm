    maintains an airfield in the disputed area; demarcation of international

                                     Economy 


 
Overview: 
    Climate, geographic remoteness, poor resource endowment, and lack of 
    infrastructure make Chad one of the most underdeveloped countries in the 
    world. Its economy is hobbled by political turmoil, conflict with Libya, 
    drought, and food shortages. Consequently the economy has shown little 
    progress in recent years in overcoming a severe setback brought on by civil 
    war in the late 1980s. More than 80% of the work force is involved in 
    subsistence farming and fishing. Cotton is the major cash crop, accounting 
    for at least half of exports. Chad is highly dependent on foreign aid, 
    especially food credits, given chronic shortages in several regions. Of all 
    the Francophone countries in Africa, Chad has benefited the least from the 
    50% devaluation of their currencies on 12 January 1994. Despite an increase 
    in external financial aid and favorable price increases for cotton - the 
    primary source of foreign exchange - the corrupt and enfeebled government 
    bureaucracy continues to dampen economic enterprise by neglecting payments 
    to domestic suppliers and public sector salaries. Oil production in the Lake
 
    Chad area remains a distant prospect and the subsistence-driven economy 
    probably will continue to limp along in the near term.
