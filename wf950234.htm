                                     Economy 
 


Overview: 
    Thailand's economy recovered rapidly from the political unrest in May 1992 
    to post an impressive 7.5% growth rate for the year, 7.8% in 1993, and 8% in
 
    1994. One of the more advanced developing countries in Asia, Thailand 
    depends on exports of manufactures and the development of the service sector
 
    to fuel the country's rapid growth. Much of Thailand's recent imports have 
    been for capital equipment, suggesting that the export sector is poised for 
    further growth. With foreign investment slowing, Bangkok is working to 
    increase the generation of domestic capital. Prime Minister CHUAN's 
    government - Thailand's fifth government in less than three years - is 
    pledged to continue Bangkok's probusiness policies, and the return of a 
    democratically elected government has improved business confidence. Even so,
 
    CHUAN must overcome divisions within his ruling coalition to complete much 
    needed infrastructure development programs if Thailand is to remain an 
    attractive place for business investment. Over the longer-term, Bangkok must
 
    produce more college graduates with technical training and upgrade workers' 
    skills to continue its rapid economic development.
