                                     Economy 
 


Overview: 
    The economy of Benin remains underdeveloped and dependent on subsistence 
    agriculture, cotton production, and regional trade. Growth in real output 
    has averaged a sound 4% in 1991-94 but this rate barely exceeds the rapid 
    population growth of 3.3%. Inflation jumped to 35% in 1994 (compared to 3% 
    in 1993) following the 50% currency devaluation in January. Commercial and 
    transport activities, which make up almost 36% of GDP, are extremely 
    vulnerable to developments in Nigeria as evidenced by decreased reexport 
    trade in 1994 due to a severe contraction in Nigerian demand. The industrial
 
    sector accounts for less than 10% of GDP and mainly produces foods, 
    beverages, cement, and textiles. Support by the Paris Club and official 
    bilateral creditors has eased the external debt situation in recent years. 
    The government, still burdened with money-losing state enterprises and a 
    bloated civil service, is gradually implementing a World Bank supported 
    structural adjustment program.
