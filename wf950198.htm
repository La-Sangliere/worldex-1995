    Oil is the backbone of the economy and accounts for more than 30% of GDP, 
    roughly 75% of export earnings, and 70% of government revenues. Proved oil 
    reserves of 3.3 billion barrels should ensure continued output at current 
    levels for about 25 years. Oil has given Qatar a per capita GDP comparable 
    to the leading West European industrial countries. Production and export of 
    natural gas are becoming increasingly important. Long-term goals feature the
 
    development of off-shore oil and the diversification of the economy.
