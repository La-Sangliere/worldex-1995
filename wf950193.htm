                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Domestic output in this primarily agricultural economy failed to grow in 
    1992 and rose only slightly in 1993. Drought and power supply problems 
    hampered production, while inadequate revenues prevented government pump 
    priming. Worker remittances helped to supplement GDP. A marked increase in 
    capital goods imports, particularly power generating equipment, 
    telecommunications equipment, and electronic data processors, contributed to
 
    20% annual import growth in 1992-94. Provided the government can cope with 
    the substantial trade deficit and meet the fiscal targets agreed to with the
 
    IMF, the Philippines should duplicate the strong growth performance of 1994 
    in 1995-96.
