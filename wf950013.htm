                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Tourism is the mainstay of the Aruban economy, although offshore banking and
 
    oil refining and storage are also important. The rapid growth of the tourism
 
    sector over the last decade has resulted in a substantial expansion of other
 
    activities. Construction has boomed, with hotel capacity five times the 1985
 


    level. Additionally, the reopening of the country's oil refinery in 1993, a 
    major source of employment and foreign exchange earnings, has further 
    spurred growth. Aruba's small labor force and less than 1% unemployment rate
 
    have led to a large number of unfilled job vacancies despite sharp rises in 
    wage rates in recent years.
