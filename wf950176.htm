                                     Economy 


 
Overview: 
    Since March 1991, when President CHAMORRO began an ambitious economic 
    stabilization program, Nicaragua has had considerable success in reducing 
    inflation and obtaining substantial economic aid from abroad. Annual 
    inflation fell from more than 750% in 1991 to less than 5% in 1992. 
    Inflation rose again to an estimated 20% in 1993, although this increase was
 
    due almost entirely to a large currency devaluation in January. As of early 
    1994, the government was close to finalizing an enhanced structural 
    adjustment facility with the IMF, after the previous standby facility 
    expired in early 1993. Despite these successes, achieving overall economic 
    growth in an economy scarred by misguided economic values and civil war 
    during the 1980s has proved elusive. Economic growth was flat in 1992 and 
    slightly negative in 1993. Nicaragua's per capita foreign debt is one of the
 
    highest in the world; nonetheless, as of late 1993, Nicaragua was current on
 
    its post-1988 debt as well as on payments to the international financial 
    institutions. Definition of property rights remains a problem; ownership 
    disputes over large tracts of land, businesses, and homes confiscated by the
 
    previous government have yet to be resolved. A rise in exports of coffee and
 
    other products led growth in 1994.
