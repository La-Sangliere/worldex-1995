                                     Economy 
 


Overview: 
    Well endowed with natural resources, Ghana is relatively well off, having 
    twice the per capita output of the poorer countries in West Africa. Heavily 
    reliant on international assistance, Ghana has made steady progress in 
    liberalizing its economy since 1983. Overall growth continued at a rate of 
    approximately 5% in 1994, due largely to increased gold, timber, and cocoa 
    production - major sources of foreign exchange. The economy, however, 
    continues to revolve around subsistence agriculture, which accounts for 45% 
    of GDP and employs 55% of the work force, mainly small landholders. Public 
    sector wage increases, regional peacekeeping commitments, and the 
    containment of internal unrest in the underdeveloped north have placed 
    substantial demands on the government's budget and have led to inflationary 
    deficit financing and a 27% depreciation of the cedi in 1994.
