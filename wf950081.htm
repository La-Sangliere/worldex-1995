                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Finland has a highly industrialized, largely free market economy, with per 
    capita output two-thirds of the US figure. Its key economic sector is 
    manufacturing - principally the wood, metals, and engineering industries. 
    Trade is important, with the export of goods representing about 30% of GDP. 
    Except for timber and several minerals, Finland depends on imports of raw 
    materials, energy, and some components for manufactured goods. Because of 
    the climate, agricultural development is limited to maintaining 
    self-sufficiency in basic products. Forestry, an important export earner, 
    provides a secondary occupation for the rural population. The economy, which
 
    experienced an average of 4.9% annual growth between 1987 and 1989, sank 
    into deep recession in 1991 as GDP contracted by 6.5%. The recession - which
 
    continued in 1992 with GDP contracting by 4.1% - has been caused by economic
 
    overheating, depressed foreign markets, and the dismantling of the barter 
    system between Finland and the former Soviet Union under which Soviet oil 
    and gas had been exchanged for Finnish manufactured goods. The Finnish 
    Government has proposed efforts to increase industrial competitiveness and 
    efficiency by an increase in exports to Western markets, cuts in public 
    expenditures, partial privatization of state enterprises, and changes in 
    monetary policy. In June 1991 Helsinki had tied the markka to the European 
    Union's (EU) European Currency Unit (ECU) to promote stability. Ongoing 
    speculation resulting from a lack of confidence in the government's policies
 
    forced Helsinki to devalue the markka by about 12% in November 1991 and to 
    indefinitely break the link in September 1992. The devaluations have boosted
 


    the competitiveness of Finnish exports. The recession bottomed out in 1993, 
    and Finland participated in the general European upturn of 1994. 
    Unemployment probably will remain a serious problem during the next few 
    years; the majority of Finnish firms face a weak domestic market and the 
    troubled German and Swedish export markets. The Finns voted in an October 
    1994 referendum to enter the EU, and Finland officially joined the Union on 
    1 January 1995. Increasing integration with Western Europe will dominate the
 
    economic picture over the next few years.
