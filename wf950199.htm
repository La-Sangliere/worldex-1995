                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    The economy has traditionally been based on agriculture. Sugarcane has been 
    the primary crop for more than a century, and in some years it accounts for 
    85% of exports. The government has been pushing the development of a tourist
 
    industry to relieve high unemployment, which recently amounted to one-third 
    of the labor force. The gap in Reunion between the well-off and the poor is 
    extraordinary and accounts for the persistent social tensions. The white and
 
    Indian communities are substantially better off than other segments of the 
    population, often approaching European standards, whereas indigenous groups 
    suffer the poverty and unemployment typical of the poorer nations of the 
    African continent. The outbreak of severe rioting in February 1991 
    illustrates the seriousness of socioeconomic tensions. The economic 
    well-being of Reunion depends heavily on continued financial assistance from
 
    France.
