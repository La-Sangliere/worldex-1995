    The Israel-PLO Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government 
    Arrangements ("the DOP"), signed in Washington on 13 September 1993, 
    provides for a transitional period not exceeding five years of Palestinian 
    interim self-government in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. Under the DOP, 
    final status negotiations are to begin no later than the beginning of the 
    third year of the transitional period.

Note: 
    Under the Israeli-PLO Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government 
    Arragements ("the DOP"), Israel agreed to transfer certain powers and 
    responsibilities to the Palestinian Authority, and subsequently to an 
    elected Palestinian Council, as part of interim self-governing arrangements 
    in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. A transfer of powers and responsibilities 
    for the Gaza Strip and Jericho has taken place pursuant to the Israel-PLO 4 
    May 1994 Cairo Agreement on the Gaza Strip and the Jericho Area. A transfer 
    of powers and responsibilities in certain spheres for the rest of the West 
    Bank has taken place pursuant to the Israel-PLO 29 August 1994 Agreement on 
    Preparatory Transfer of Powers and Responsibilities. The DOP provides that 
    Israel will retain responsibility during the transitional period for 
    external security and for internal security and public order of settlements 


    and Israelis. Final status is to be determined through direct negotiations 
    within five years.

                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Economic progress in the West Bank has been hampered by Israeli military 
    administration and the effects of the Palestinian uprising (intifadah). 
    Industries using advanced technology or requiring sizable investment have 
    been discouraged by a lack of local capital and restrictive Israeli 
    policies. Capital investment consists largely of residential housing, not 
    productive assets that would enable local Palestinian firms to compete with 
    Israeli industry. GDP has been substantially supplemented by remittances of 
    workers employed in Israel and Persian Gulf states. Such transfers from the 
    Gulf dropped after Iraq invaded Kuwait in August 1990. In the wake of the 
    Persian Gulf crisis, many Palestinians have returned to the West Bank, 
    increasing unemployment, and export revenues have dropped because of the 
    decline of markets in Jordan and the Gulf states. Israeli measures to 
    curtail the intifadah also have added to unemployment and lowered living 
    standards. The area's economic situation has worsened since Israel's partial
 
    closure of the territories in 1993.
