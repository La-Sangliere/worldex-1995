                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Though foreign investment in manufacturing and information processing in 
    recent years has increased Saint Lucia's industrial base, the economy 
    remains vulnerable due to its heavy dependence on banana production, which 
    is subject to periodic droughts and tropical storms. Indeed, the destructive
 
    effect of Tropical Storm Debbie in mid-1994 caused the loss of 60% of the 


    year's banana crop. Increased competition from Latin American bananas will 
    probably further reduce market prices, exacerbating Saint Lucia's need to 
    diversify its economy in coming years, e.g., by expanding tourism, 
    manufacturing, and construction
