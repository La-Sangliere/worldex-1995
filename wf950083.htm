                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    The economy is tied closely to that of France through subsidies and imports.
 
    Besides the French space center at Kourou, fishing and forestry are the most
 
    important economic activities, with exports of fish and fish products 
    (mostly shrimp) accounting for more than 60% of total revenue in 1992. The 
    large reserves of tropical hardwoods, not fully exploited, support an 
    expanding sawmill industry that provides sawn logs for export. Cultivation 
    of crops - rice, cassava, bananas, and sugarcane - is limited to the coastal
 
    area, where the population is largely concentrated. French Guiana is heavily
 
    dependent on imports of food and energy. Unemployment is a serious problem, 
    particularly among younger workers.
