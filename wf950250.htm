                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Uruguay's economy is a small one with favorable climate, good soils, and 
    substantial hydropower potential. Economic development has been restrained 
    in recent years by excessive government regulation of economic detail and 
    40% to 130% inflation. Although the GDP growth rate slowed in 1993 to 1.7%, 
    following a healthy expansion to 7.5% in 1992, it rebounded in 1994 to an 
    estimated 4%, spurred mostly by increasing agricultural and other exports 
    and a surprise reversal of the downward trend in industrial production. In a
 
    major step toward regional economic cooperation, Uruguay confirmed its 
    commitment to the Southern Cone Common Market (MERCOSUR) customs union by 
    implementing MERCOSUR's common external tariff on most tradables on 1 
    January 1995. Inflation in 1994 declined for the third consecutive year, 
    yet, at 44%, it remains the highest in the region; analysts predict that the
 
    expanding fiscal deficit and wage indexation will force the inflation rate 
    back toward the 50% mark in 1995.
