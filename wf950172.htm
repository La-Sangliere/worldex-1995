                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    This highly developed and affluent economy is based on private enterprise. 
    The government makes its presence felt, however, through many regulations, 
    permit requirements, and welfare programs affecting most aspects of economic
 
    activity. The trade and financial services sector contributes over 50% of 
    GDP. Industrial activity provides about 25% of GDP and is led by the 
    food-processing, oil-refining, and metalworking industries. The highly 
    mechanized agricultural sector employs only 4% of the labor force, but 
    provides large surpluses for export and the domestic food-processing 
    industry. Indeed the Netherlands ranks third worldwide in value of 
    agricultural exports, behind the US and France. High unemployment and a 
    sizable budget deficit are currently the most serious economic problems. 
    Many of the economic issues of the 1990s will reflect the course of European
 
    economic integration.
