                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Taiwan has a dynamic capitalist economy with considerable government 
    guidance of investment and foreign trade and partial government ownership of
 
    some large banks and industrial firms. Real growth in GNP has averaged about
 
    9% a year during the past three decades. Export growth has been even faster 
    and has provided the impetus for industrialization. Inflation and 
    unemployment are remarkably low. Agriculture contributes about 4% to GDP, 
    down from 35% in 1952. Taiwan currently ranks as number 13 among major 
    trading countries. Traditional labor-intensive industries are steadily being
 
    replaced with more capital- and technology-intensive industries. Taiwan has 
    become a major investor in China, Thailand, Indonesia, the Philippines, 
    Malaysia, and Vietnam. The tightening of labor markets has led to an influx 
    of foreign workers, both legal and illegal.
