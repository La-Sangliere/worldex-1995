                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    One of the world's poorest and least developed countries, Somalia has few 
    resources. Moreover, much of the economy has been devastated by the civil 
    war. Agriculture is the most important sector, with livestock accounting for
 
    about 40% of GDP and about 65% of export earnings. Nomads and seminomads who
 
    are dependent upon livestock for their livelihood make up about 70% of the 
    population. Crop production generates only 10% of GDP and employs about 20% 
    of the work force. The main export crop is bananas; sugar, sorghum, and corn
 
    are grown for the domestic market. The small industrial sector is based on 
    the processing of agricultural products and accounts for less than 10% of 
    GDP; most facilities have been shut down because of the civil strife. The 
    greatly increased political turmoil of 1991-93 has resulted in a substantial
 
    drop in agricultural output, with widespread famine. In 1994 economic 
    conditions stabilized in the countryside but may turn worse in 1995 if civil
 
    strife intensifies after the UN withdrawal.
