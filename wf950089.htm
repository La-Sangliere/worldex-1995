Note: 
    Georgia has been beset by ethnic and civil strife since independence. In 
    late 1991, the country's first elected president, Zviad GAMSAKHURDIA was 
    ousted in an armed coup. In October 1993, GAMSAKHURDIA, and his supporters 
    sponsored a failed attempt to retake power from the current government led 
    by former Soviet Foreign Minister Eduard SHEVARDNADZE. The Georgian 
    government has also faced armed separatist conflicts in the Abkhazia and 
    South Ossetia regions. A cease-fire went into effect in South Ossetia in 
    June 1992 and a joint Georgian-Ossetian-Russian peacekeeping force has been 
    in place since that time. Georgian forces were driven out of the Abkhaz 
    region in September 1993 after a yearlong war with Abkhaz separatists. 
    Nearly 200,000 Georgian refugees have since fled Abkhazia, adding 
    substantially to the estimated 100,000 internally displaced persons already 
    in Georgia. Russian peacekeepers are deployed along the border of Abkhazia 
    and the rest of Georgia.

                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Georgia's economy has traditionally revolved around Black Sea tourism; 
    cultivation of citrus fruits, tea, and grapes; mining of manganese and 
    copper; and a small industrial sector producing wine, metals, machinery, 
    chemicals, and textiles. The country imports the bulk of its energy needs, 
    including natural gas and oil products. Its only sizable domestic energy 
    resource is hydropower. Since 1990, widespread conflicts, e.g., in Abkhazia,
 
    South Ossetia, and Mingreliya, have severely aggravated the economic crisis 
    resulting from the disintegration of the Soviet command economy in December 
    1991. Throughout 1993 and 1994, much of industry was functioning at only 20%
 
    of capacity; heavy disruptions in agricultural cultivation were reported; 
    and tourism was shut down. The country is precariously dependent on US and 
    EU humanitarian grain shipments, as most other foods are priced beyond reach
 
    of the average citizen. Georgia is also suffering from an acute energy 
    crisis, as it is having problems paying for even minimal imports. Georgia is
 
    pinning its hopes for recovery on reestablishing trade ties with Russia and 
    on developing international transportation through the key Black Sea ports 
    of P'ot'i and Bat'umi. The government began a tenuous program in 1994 aiming
 
    to stabilize prices and reduce large consumer subsidies.
