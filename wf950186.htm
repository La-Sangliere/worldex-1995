                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    The economy consists primarily of subsistence agriculture and fishing. The 
    government is the major employer of the work force, relying heavily on 
    financial assistance from the US. The compact of "free association" with the
 
    United States, entered into after the end of the UN trusteeship on 1 October
 
    1994, provides Palau with $500 million in US aid over 15 years in return for
 
    furnishing some military facilities. The population, in effect, enjoys a per
 
    capita income of $5,000, twice that of the Philippines and much of 
    Micronesia. Long-run prospects for the tourist sector have been greatly 
    bolstered by the expansion of air travel in the Pacific and the rapidly 
    rising prosperity of leading East Asian countries.
