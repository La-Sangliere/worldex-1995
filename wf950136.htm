                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    The government of Laos - one of the few remaining official Communist states 
    - has been decentralizing control and encouraging private enterprise since 
    1986. The results, starting from an extremely low base, have been striking -
 
    growth has averaged 7.5% annually since 1988. Even so, Laos is a landlocked 
    country with a primitive infrastructure. It has no railroads, a rudimentary 
    road system, and limited external and internal telecommunications. 
    Electricity is available in only a few urban areas. Subsistence agriculture 
    accounts for half of GDP and provides 80% of total employment. The 
    predominant crop is rice. In non-drought years, Laos is self-sufficient 
    overall in food, but each year flood, pests, and localized drought cause 
    shortages in various parts of the country. For the foreseeable future the 
    economy will continue to depend on aid from the IMF and other international 
    sources; aid from the former USSR and Eastern Europe has been cut sharply. 
    As in many developing countries, deforestation and soil erosion will hamper 
    efforts to maintain the high rate of GDP growth.
