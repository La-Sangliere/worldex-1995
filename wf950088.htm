Note: 
    The Israel-PLO Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government 
    Arrangements ("the DOP"), signed in Washington on 13 September 1993, 
    provides for a transitional period not exceeding five years of Palestinian 
    interim self-government in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank. Under the DOP, 
    final status negotiations are to begin no later than the beginning of the 
    third year of the transitional period.

Note: 
    Under the Israeli-PLO Declaration of Principles on Interim Self-Government 
    Arrangements ("the DOP"), Israel agreed to transfer certain powers and 
    responsibilities to the Palestinian Authority, and subsequently to an 
    elected Palestinian Council, as part of interim self-governing arrangements 
    in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. A transfer of powers and responsibilities 
    for the Gaza Strip and Jericho has taken place pursuant to the Israel-PLO 4 
    May 1994 Cairo Agreement on the Gaza Strip and the Jericho Area. The DOP 
    provides that Israel will retain responsibility during the transitional 
    period for external security and for internal security and public order of 
    settlements and Israelis. Final status is to be determined through direct 
    negotiations within five years.

                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    In 1991 roughly 40% of Gaza Strip workers were employed across the border by
 
    Israeli industrial, construction, and agricultural enterprises, with worker 
    remittances supplementing GDP by roughly 50%. Gaza depends upon Israel for 
    nearly 90% of its external trade. Aggravating the impact of Israeli military
 
    administration, unrest in the territory since 1988 (intifadah) has raised 
    unemployment and lowered the standard of living of Gazans. The Persian Gulf 
    crisis and its aftershocks also have dealt blows to Gaza since August 1990. 
    Worker remittances from the Gulf states have dropped, unemployment has 
    increased, and exports have fallen. The withdrawal of Israel from the Gaza 
    Strip in May 1994 brings a new set of adjustment problems.
