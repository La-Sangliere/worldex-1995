                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Austria boasts a prosperous and stable market economy with a sizable but 
    falling proportion of nationalized industry and with extensive welfare 
    benefits. Thanks to its raw material endowment, a technically skilled labor 
    force, and strong links to German industrial firms, Austria occupies 
    specialized niches in European industry and services (tourism, banking) and 
    produces almost enough food to feed itself with only 8% of the labor force 
    in agriculture. After 11 consecutive years of growth, the Austrian economy 
    experienced a mild recession in 1993, but growth resumed in 1994. 


    Unemployment is 4.3% and will likely stay at that level as companies adjust 
    to the competition of EU membership beginning 1 January 1995. To prepare for
 
    EU membership, Austria's government has taken measures to open the economy 
    by introducing a major tax reform, privatizing state-owned firms, and 
    liberalizing cross-border capital movements. Problems for the 1990s include 
    an aging population, the high level of industrial subsidies, and the 
    struggle to keep welfare benefits within budgetary capabilities - the 
    deficit climbed to over 4% of GDP in 1994.
