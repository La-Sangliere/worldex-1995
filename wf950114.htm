                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Indonesia is a mixed economy with some socialist institutions and central 
    planning but with a recent emphasis on deregulation and private enterprise. 
    Indonesia has extensive natural wealth, yet, with a large and rapidly 


    increasing population, it remains a rather poor country. Real GDP growth in 
    1985-94 averaged about 6%, quite impressive, but not sufficient to both 
    slash underemployment and absorb the 2.3 million workers annually entering 
    the labor force. Agriculture, including forestry and fishing, is an 
    important sector, accounting for 21% of GDP and over 50% of the labor force.
 
    The staple crop is rice. Once the world's largest rice importer, Indonesia 
    is now nearly self-sufficient. Plantation crops - rubber and palm oil - and 
    textiles and plywood are being encouraged for both export and job 
    generation. Industrial output now accounts for almost 40% of GDP and is 
    based on a supply of diverse natural resources, including crude oil, natural
 
    gas, timber, metals, and coal. Foreign investment has also boosted 
    manufacturing output and exports in recent years. Indeed, the economy's 
    growth is highly dependent on the continuing expansion of nonoil exports. 
    Japan remains Indonesia's most important customer and supplier of aid. Rapid
 
    growth in the money supply in 1989-90 prompted Jakarta to implement a tight 
    monetary policy in 1991, forcing the private sector to go to foreign banks 
    for investment financing. Real interest rates remained above 10% and 
    off-shore commercial debt grew. The growth in off-shore debt prompted 
    Jakarta to limit foreign borrowing beginning in late 1991. Despite the 
    continued problems in moving toward a more open financial system and the 
    persistence of a fairly tight credit situation, GDP growth in 1992-94 has 
    matched the government target of 6%-7% annual growth.
