Note: 
    Civil war has been the norm since independence from Portugal on 11 November

    refused to accept its defeat in internationally monitored elections and 
    fighting resumed throughout much of the countryside. The two sides signed 
    another peace accord on 20 November 1994; the cease-fire is generally 
    holding but most provisions of the accord remain to be implemented.

                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Subsistence agriculture provides the main livelihood for 80%-90% of the 


    population but accounts for less than 15% of GDP. Oil production is vital to
 
    the economy, contributing about 60% to GDP. Despite the signing of a peace 
    accord in November 1994 between the Angola government and the UNITA 
    insurgents, sporadic fighting continues and many farmers remain reluctant to
 
    return to their fields. As a result, much of the country's food requirements
 
    must still be imported. Angola has rich natural resources - notably gold, 
    diamonds, and arable land, in addition to large oil deposits - but will need
 
    to observe the cease-fire, implement the peace agreement, and reform 
    government policies if it is to achieve its potential.
