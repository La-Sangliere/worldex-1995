                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Offshore banking, manufacturing, and tourism are key sectors of the economy.
 
    The government's policy of offering incentives to high-technology companies 
    and financial institutions to locate on the island has paid off in expanding
 
    employment opportunities in high-income industries. As a result, agriculture
 


    and fishing, once the mainstays of the economy, have declined in their 
    shares of GDP. Banking now contributes about 45% to GDP. Trade is mostly 
    with the UK. The Isle of Man enjoys free access to European Union markets.
