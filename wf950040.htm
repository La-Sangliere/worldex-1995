Overview: 
    One of the poorest countries in the world, Burkina has a high population 
    density and a high population growth rate, few natural resources, and a 
    fragile soil. Economic development is hindered by a poor communications 
    network within a landlocked country. Agriculture provides about 40% of GDP 
    and is mainly of a subsistence nature. Industry, dominated by unprofitable 
    government-controlled corporations, accounts for about 15% of GDP. Following
 
    the 50% currency devaluation in January 1994, the government updated its 
    development program in conjunction with international agencies. Even with 
    the best of plans, however, the government faces formidable problems on all 
    sides.
