                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Tunisia has a diverse economy, with important agricultural, mining, energy, 
    tourism, and manufacturing sectors. Detailed governmental control of 
    economic affairs has gradually lessened over the past decade, including 
    increasing privatization of trade and commerce, simplification of the tax 
    structure, and a cautious approach to debt. Real growth has averaged roughly
 
    5% in 1991-94, and inflation has been moderate. Growth in tourism and IMF 
    support have been key elements in this solid record. Further privatization 
    and further improvements in government administrative efficiency are among 
    the challenges for the future.
