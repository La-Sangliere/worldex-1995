                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    The economy, one of the most prosperous in the Caribbean area, is highly 
    dependent on the tourist industry, which generates about 21% of the national
 
    income. In 1985 the government offered offshore registration to companies 
    wishing to incorporate in the islands, and, in consequence, incorporation 
    fees generated about $2 million in 1987. The economy slowed in 1991 because 
    of the poor performances of the tourist sector and tight commercial bank 
    credit. Livestock raising is the most significant agricultural activity. The
 
    islands' crops, limited by poor soils, are unable to meet food requirements.
