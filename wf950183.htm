                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Economic performance is closely tied to the fortunes of the oil industry, 


    including trends in international oil prices and the ability of OPEC 
    producers to agree on output quotas. Petroleum accounts for more than 85% of
 
    export earnings, about 80% of government revenues, and roughly 40% of GDP. 
    Oman has proved oil reserves of 4 billion barrels, equivalent to about 20 
    years' supply at the current rate of extraction. Agriculture is carried on 
    at a subsistence level and the general population depends on imported food. 
    The government is encouraging private investment, both domestic and foreign,
 
    as a prime force for further economic development.
