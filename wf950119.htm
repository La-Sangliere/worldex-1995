                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Since World War II the Italian economy has changed from one based on 
    agriculture into a ranking industrial economy, with approximately the same 
    total and per capita output as France and the UK. The country is still 
    divided into a developed industrial north, dominated by private companies, 
    and an undeveloped agricultural south, dominated by large public 
    enterprises. Services account for 48% of GDP, industry 35%, agriculture 4%, 
    and public administration 13%. Most raw materials needed by industry and 
    over 75% of energy requirements must be imported. After growing at an 
    average annual rate of 3% in 1983-90, growth slowed to about 1% in 1991 and 
    1992, fell by 0.7% in 1993, and recovered to 2% in 1994. In the second half 
    of 1992, Rome became unsettled by the prospect of not qualifying to 
    participate in EU plans for economic and monetary union later in the decade;
 
    thus it finally began to address its huge fiscal imbalances. Subsequently, 
    the government has adopted fairly stringent budgets, abandoned its highly 
    inflationary wage indexation system, and started to scale back its extremely
 
    generous social welfare programs, including pension and health care 
    benefits. Monetary officials were forced to withdraw the lira from the 
    European monetary system in September 1992 when it came under extreme 
    pressure in currency markets. For the 1990s, Italy faces the problems of 
    pushing ahead with fiscal reform, refurbishing a tottering communications 
    system, curbing pollution in major industrial centers, and adjusting to the 
    new competitive forces accompanying the ongoing expansion and economic 
    integration of the European Union.
