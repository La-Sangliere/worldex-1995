                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Uganda has substantial natural resources, including fertile soils, regular 
    rainfall, and sizable mineral deposits of copper and cobalt. Agriculture is 
    the most important sector of the economy, employing over 80% of the work 
    force. Coffee is the major export crop and accounts for the bulk of export 
    revenues. Since 1986 the government - with the support of foreign countries 
    and international agencies - has acted to rehabilitate and stabilize the 
    economy by undertaking currency reform, raising producer prices on export 
    crops, increasing prices of petroleum products, and improving civil service 
    wages. The policy changes are especially aimed at dampening inflation and 
    boosting production and export earnings. In 1990-94, the economy turned in a
 
    solid performance based on continued investment in the rehabilitation of 
    infrastructure, improved incentives for production and exports, and 
    gradually improving domestic security. The economy again prospered in 1994 
    with rapid growth, low inflation, growing foreign investment, a trimmed 
    bureaucracy, and the continued return of exiled Indian-Ugandan 
    entrepreneurs.
