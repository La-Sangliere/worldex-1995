    consequence of cutting down the forests, the mountainous terrain of Futuna 
    is particularly prone to erosion; there are no permanent settlements on 
    Alofi because of the lack of natural fresh water resources

    subsidies, licensing of fishing rights to Japan and South Korea, import 
    taxes, and remittances from expatriate workers in New Caledonia. Wallis and
