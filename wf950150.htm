                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Fishing is the largest industry, employing 25% of the work force and 
    accounting for over 60% of exports. Over 90% of government tax revenue comes
 
    from import duties and tourism-related taxes. During the 1980s tourism 
    became one of the most important and highest growth sectors of the economy. 
    In 1993, tourism accounted for 17% of GDP and more than 60% of the Maldives'
 
    foreign exchange receipts. The Maldivian government initiated an economic 
    reform program in 1989 initially by lifting import quotas and opening some 
    exports to the private sector. Subsequently, it has liberalized regulations 
    to allow more foreign investment. Agriculture and manufacturing continue to 
    play a minor role in the economy, constrained by the limited availability of
 
    cultivatable land and the shortage of domestic labor. Most staple foods must
 
    be imported. In 1993, industry which consisted mainly of garment production,
 
    boat building, and handicrafts accounted for about 6% of GDP.
