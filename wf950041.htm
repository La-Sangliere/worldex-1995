                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Burma has a mixed economy with about 75% private activity, mainly in 
    agriculture, light industry, and transport, and with about 25% 
    state-controlled activity, mainly in energy, heavy industry, and foreign 


    trade. Government policy in the last six years, 1989-94, has aimed at 
    revitalizing the economy after four decades of tight central planning. Thus,
 
    private activity has markedly increased; foreign investment has been 
    encouraged, so far with moderate success; and efforts continue to increase 
    the efficiency of state enterprises. Published estimates of Burma's foreign 
    trade are greatly understated because of the volume of black market trade. A
 
    major ongoing problem is the failure to achieve monetary and fiscal 
    stability. Although Burma remains a poor Asian country, its rich resources 
    furnish the potential for substantial long-term increases in income, 
    exports, and living standards.
