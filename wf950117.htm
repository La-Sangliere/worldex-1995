                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    The economy is small and trade dependent. Agriculture, once the most 
    important sector, is now dwarfed by industry, which accounts for 37% of GDP,
 
    about 80% of exports, and employs 28% of the labor force. Although exports 
    remain the primary engine for Ireland's robust growth, the economy is also 
    benefiting from a rise in consumer spending and recovery in both 
    construction and business investment. Ireland has substantially reduced its 
    external debt since 1987, to 40% of GDP in 1994. Over the same period, 
    inflation has fallen sharply and chronic trade deficits have been 
    transformed into annual surpluses. Unemployment remains a serious problem, 
    however, and job creation is the main focus of government policy. To ease 
    unemployment, Dublin aggressively courts foreign investors and recently 
    created a new industrial development agency to aid small indigenous firms. 
    Government assistance is constrained by Dublin's continuing deficit 
    reduction measures.
