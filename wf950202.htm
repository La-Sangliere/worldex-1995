                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Rwanda is a poor African nation suffering bitterly from ethnic-based civil 
    war. Almost 50% of GDP comes from the agricultural sector; coffee and tea 
    make up 80%-90% of total exports. The amount of fertile land is limited, 
    however, and deforestation and soil erosion continue to create problems. The
 
    industrial sector in Rwanda is small, contributing only 17% to GDP. 
    Manufacturing focuses mainly on the processing of agricultural products. The
 
    Rwandan economy remains dependent on coffee/tea exports and foreign aid. 
    Weak international prices since 1986 have caused the economy to contract and
 
    per capita GDP to decline. A structural adjustment program with the World 
    Bank began in October 1990. Ethnic-based insurgency since 1990 has 
    devastated wide areas, especially in the north, and displaced hundreds of 
    thousands of people. A peace accord in mid-1993 temporarily ended most of 
    the fighting, but massive resumption of civil warfare in April 1994 in the 
    capital city Kigali and elsewhere has been taking thousands of lives and 
    severely affecting short-term economic prospects. The economy suffers 


    massively from failure to maintain the infrastructure, looting, neglect of 
    important cash crops, and lack of health care facilities.
