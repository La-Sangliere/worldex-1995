                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    The economy has historically been based on cattle raising and crops. 
    Agriculture today provides a livelihood for more than 80% of the population 
    but supplies only about 50% of food needs and accounts for only 5% of GDP. 
    Subsistence farming and cattle raising predominate. The driving force behind
 
    the rapid economic growth of the 1970s and 1980s has been the mining 
    industry. This sector, mostly on the strength of diamonds, has gone from 
    generating 25% of GDP in 1980 to 39% in 1994. No other sector has 
    experienced such growth, especially not agriculture, which is plagued by 
    erratic rainfall and poor soils. The unemployment rate remains a problem at 
    25%. Hampered by a still sluggish diamond market in 1994, GDP grew by only 
    1%.
