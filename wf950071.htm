                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Half of Egypt's GDP originates in the public sector, most industrial plants 
    being owned by the government. Overregulation holds back technical 
    modernization and foreign investment. Even so, the economy grew rapidly 
    during the late 1970s and early 1980s, but in 1986 the collapse of world oil
 
    prices and an increasingly heavy burden of debt servicing led Egypt to begin
 
    negotiations with the IMF for balance-of-payments support. Egypt's first IMF
 
    standby arrangement concluded in mid-1987 was suspended in early 1988 
    because of the government's failure to adopt promised reforms. Egypt signed 
    a follow-on program with the IMF and also negotiated a structural adjustment
 
    loan with the World Bank in 1991. In 1991-93 the government made solid 
    progress on administrative reforms such as liberalizing exchange and 
    interest rates but resisted implementing major structural reforms like 
    streamlining the public sector. As a result, the economy has not gained 
    momentum and unemployment has become a growing problem. Egypt probably will 
    continue making uneven progress in implementing the successor programs with 
    the IMF and World Bank it signed onto in late 1993. Tourism has plunged 
    since 1992 because of sporadic attacks by Islamic extremists on tourist 
    groups. President MUBARAK has cited population growth as the main cause of 
    the country's economic troubles. The addition of about 1.2 million people a 
    year to the already huge population of 62 million exerts enormous pressure 
    on the 5% of the land area available for agriculture along the Nile.
