                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    An extremely poor country by European standards, Albania is making the 
    difficult transition to a more open-market economy. The economy rebounded in
 
    1993-94 after a severe depression accompanying the collapse of the previous 
    centrally planned system in 1990 and 1991. Stabilization policies - 
    including a strict monetary policy, public sector layoffs, and reduced 
    social services - have improved the government's fiscal situation and 
    reduced inflation. The recovery was spurred by the remittances of some 20% 
    of the population which works abroad, mostly in Greece and Italy. These 
    remittances supplement GDP and help offset the large foreign trade deficit. 
    Foreign assistance and humanitarian aid also supported the recovery. Most 
    agricultural land was privatized in 1992, substantially improving peasant 
    incomes. Albania's limited industrial sector, now less than one-sixth of 
    GDP, continued to decline in 1994. A sharp fall in chromium prices reduced 
    hard currency receipts from the mining sector. Large segments of the 
    population, especially those living in urban areas, continue to depend on 
    humanitarian aid to meet basic food requirements. Unemployment remains a 
    severe problem accounting for approximately one-fifth of the work force. 
    Growth is expected to continue in 1995, but could falter if Albania becomes 
    involved in the conflict in the former Yugoslavia, workers' remittances from
 
    Greece are reduced, or foreign assistance declines.
