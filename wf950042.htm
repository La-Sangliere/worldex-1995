Overview: 
    A landlocked, resource-poor country in an early stage of economic 
    development, Burundi since October 1993 has suffered from massive 
    ethnic-based violence that has displaced an estimated million people, 
    disrupted production, and set back needed reform programs. Burundi is 
    predominately agricultural with roughly 90% of the population dependent on 
    subsistence agriculture. Its economic health depends on the coffee crop, 
    which accounts for 80% of foreign exchange earnings. The ability to pay for 
    imports therefore continues to rest largely on the vagaries of the climate 
    and the international coffee market. As part of its economic reform agenda, 
    launched in February 1991 with IMF and World Bank support, Burundi is trying
 
    to diversify its agricultural exports, attract foreign investment in 
    industry, and modernize government budgetary practices. Although the 
    government remains committed to reforms, it fears new austerity measures 
    would add to ethnic tensions.
