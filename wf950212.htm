Note: 
    Serbia and Montenegro have asserted the formation of a joint independent 
    state, but this entity has not been formally recognized as a state by the 
    US; the US view is that the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia (SFRY) 
    has dissolved and that none of the successor republics represents its 
    continuation

                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    The swift collapse of the Yugoslav federation in 1991 has been followed by 
    bloody ethnic warfare, the destabilization of republic boundaries, and the 
    breakup of important interrepublic trade flows. Serbia and Montenegro faces 
    major economic problems; output has dropped sharply, particularly in 1993. 
    First, like the other former Yugoslav republics, it depended on its sister 
    republics for large amounts of foodstuffs, energy supplies, and 


    manufactures. Wide differences in climate, mineral resources, and levels of 
    technology among the republics accentuated this interdependence, as did the 
    communist practice of concentrating much industrial output in a small number
 
    of giant plants. The breakup of many of the trade links, the sharp drop in 
    output as industrial plants lost suppliers and markets, and the destruction 
    of physical assets in the fighting all have contributed to the economic 
    difficulties of the republics. One singular factor in the economic situation
 
    of Serbia and Montenegro is the continuation in office of a communist 
    government that is primarily interested in political and military mastery, 
    not economic reform. A further complication is the imposition of economic 
    sanctions by the UN in 1992. Hyperinflation ended with the establishment of 
    a new currency unit in June 1993; prices were relatively stable in 1994. 
    Reliable statistics are hard to come by; the GDP estimate of $1,000 per 
    capita in 1994 is extremely rough. Output in 1994 seems to have leveled off 
    after the plunge in 1993.

Agriculture: 
    the fertile plains of Vojvodina produce 80% of the cereal production of the 
    former Yugoslavia and most of the cotton, oilseeds, and chicory; Vojvodina 
    also produces fodder crops to support intensive beef and dairy production; 
    Serbia proper, although hilly, has a well-distributed rainfall and a long 
    growing season; produces fruit, grapes, and cereals; in this area, livestock
 
    production (sheep and cattle) and dairy farming prosper; Kosovo produces 
    fruits, vegetables, tobacco, and a small amount of cereals; the mountainous 
    pastures of Kosovo and Montenegro support sheep and goat husbandry; 
    Montenegro has only a small agriculture sector, mostly near the coast where 
    a Mediterranean climate permits the culture of olives, citrus, grapes, and 
    rice
