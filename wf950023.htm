                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    A per capita income of $9,200 gives Barbados one of the highest standards of
 
    living of all the small island states of the eastern Caribbean. 
    Historically, the economy was based on the cultivation of sugarcane and 
    related activities. In recent years, however, the economy has diversified 
    into manufacturing and tourism. A moderate recovery that began in late 1993 
    after 3 years of contraction is mainly due to increased tourism and 
    expansion in the construction sector. Economic prospects for 1995 depend 
    mostly on continued growth in the industrialized countries, especially in 
    Europe, which would spur further expansion in tourism.
