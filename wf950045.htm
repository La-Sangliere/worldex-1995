                                     Canada 
 
                                    Geography 
 
Location: 
    Northern North America, bordering the North Atlantic Ocean and North Pacific
 
    Ocean, north of the conterminous US 
Map references: 
    North America 
Area: 
  total area: 
    9,976,140 sq km

    slightly larger than US 


Land boundaries: 
    total 8,893 km, US 8,893 km (includes 2,477 km with Alaska) 
Coastline: 
    243,791 km

  continental shelf: 
    200 nm or to the edge of the continental margin 
  exclusive fishing zone: 
    200 nm 
  territorial sea: 
    12 nm

    of maritime boundary dispute between Canada and France 
Climate: 
    varies from temperate in south to subarctic and arctic in north 
Terrain: 
    mostly plains with mountains in west and lowlands in southeast 
Natural resources: 
    nickel, zinc, copper, gold, lead, molybdenum, potash, silver, fish, timber, 
    wildlife, coal, petroleum, natural gas 
Land use:

    activities 
  natural hazards: 
    continuous permafrost in north is a serious obstacle to development; 
    cyclonic storms form east of the Rocky Mountains, a result of the mixing of 
    air masses from the Arctic, Pacific, and American interior, and produce most
 
    of the country's rain and snow

                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    As an affluent, high-tech industrial society, Canada today closely resembles
 
    the US in per capita output, market-oriented economic system, and pattern of
 
    production. Since World War II the impressive growth of the manufacturing, 
    mining, and service sectors has transformed the nation from a largely rural 
    economy into one primarily industrial and urban. In the 1980s, Canada 
    registered one of the highest rates of real growth among the OECD nations, 
    averaging about 3.2%. With its great natural resources, skilled labor force,
 
    and modern capital plant, Canada has excellent economic prospects, although 
    the country still faces high unemployment and a growing debt. Moreover, the 
    continuing constitutional impasse between English- and French-speaking areas
 
    has observers discussing a possible split in the confederation; foreign 
    investors have become edgy.
