                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Since 1989 Hungary has been a leader in the transition from a socialist 
    command economy to a market economy - thanks in large part to its initial 
    economic reforms during the Communist era. The private sector now accounts 
    for about 55% of GDP. Nonetheless, the transformation is proving difficult, 
    and many citizens say life was better under the old system. On the bright 
    side, the four-year decline in output finally ended in 1994, as real GDP 
    increased an estimated 3%. This growth helped reduce unemployment to just 
    over 10% by yearend, down from a peak of 13%. However, no progress was made 
    against inflation, which remained stuck at about 20%, and the already-large 
    current account deficit in the balance of payments actually got worse, 
    reaching almost $4 billion. Underlying Hungary's other economic problems is 
    the large budget deficit, which probably exceeded 7% of GDP in 1994, despite
 
    some late-year budget cutting by the new leftist government. In 1995 the 
    government has pledged to accelerate privatization and lower the budget 
    deficit to 5.5% of GDP. It believes this fiscal tightening will reduce the 
    current account deficit to $2.5 billion but at the cost of holding economic 
    growth to only 1%.
