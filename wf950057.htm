                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Congo's economy is a mixture of village agriculture and handicrafts, an 
    industrial sector based largely on oil, support services, and a government 
    characterized by budget problems and overstaffing. A reform program, 
    supported by the IMF and World Bank, ran into difficulties in 1990-91 
    because of problems in changing to a democratic political regime and a heavy
 
    debt-servicing burden. Oil has supplanted forestry as the mainstay of the 
    economy, providing about two-thirds of government revenues and exports. In 
    the early 1980s rapidly rising oil revenues enabled Congo to finance 
    large-scale development projects with growth averaging 5% annually, one of 
    the highest rates in Africa. Subsequently, growth has slowed to an average 
    of roughly 1.5% annually, only two-thirds of the population growth rate. 
    Political turmoil and misguided government investment have derailed economic
 
    reform programs sponsored by the IMF and World Bank. Even with these 
    difficulties Congo enjoys one of the highest incomes per capita in 
    sub-Saharan Africa
