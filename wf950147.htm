                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Madagascar is one of the poorest countries in the world, suffering from 
    chronic malnutrition, underfunded health and education facilities, a 3% 
    annual population growth rate, and severe loss of forest cover, accompanied 
    by erosion. Agriculture, including fishing and forestry, is the mainstay of 
    the economy, accounting for over 30% of GDP and contributing more than 70% 
    of total export earnings. Industry is largely confined to the processing of 
    agricultural products and textile manufacturing; in 1991 it accounted for 
    only 13% of GDP. In 1986 the government introduced a five-year development 
    plan that stressed self-sufficiency in food (mainly rice) by 1990, increased
 
    production for exports, and reduced energy imports. Subsequently, growth in 
    output has been held back because of protracted antigovernment strikes and 
    demonstrations for political reform. Since 1993, corruption and political 
    instability have caused the economy and infrastructure to decay further. 
    Since April 1994, the government commitment to economic reforms has been 
    erratic. Enormous obstacles stand in the way of Madagascar's realizing its 
    considerable growth potential.
