                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    This is a well-to-do oil-based economy with strong government controls over 
    major economic activities. About 46% of GDP comes from the private sector. 
    Economic (as well as political) ties with the US are especially strong. The 
    petroleum sector accounts for roughly 75% of budget revenues, 35% of GDP, 


    and almost all export earnings. Saudi Arabia has the largest reserves of 
    petroleum in the world (26% of the proved total), ranks as the largest 
    exporter of petroleum, and plays a leading role in OPEC. For the 1990s the 
    government intends to bring its budget, which has been in deficit since 
    1983, back into balance, and to encourage private economic activity. Roughly
 
    four million foreign workers play an important role in the Saudi economy, 
    for example, in the oil and banking sectors. For about a decade, Saudi 
    Arabia's domestic and international outlays have outstripped its income, and
 
    the government has cut its foreign assistance and is beginning to rein in 
    domestic programs. For 1995, the country looks for improvement in oil prices
 
    and will continue its policies of restraining public spending and 
    encouraging non-oil exports.
