                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Agriculture provides the economic base. The major export earners are fruit, 
    copra, and clothing. Manufacturing activities are limited to a 
    fruit-processing plant and several clothing factories. Economic development 
    is hindered by the isolation of the islands from foreign markets and a lack 


    of natural resources and good transportation links. A large trade deficit is
 
    annually made up for by remittances from emigrants and from foreign aid, 
    largely from New Zealand. Current economic development plans call for 
    exploiting the tourism potential and expanding the fishing industry.
