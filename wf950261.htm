Area: 
  total area: 
    510.072 million sq km 
  land area: 
    148.94 million sq km 
  water area: 
    361.132 million sq km 
  comparative area: 
    land area about 16 times the size of the US 
  note: 
    70.8% of the world is water, 29.2% is land 
Land boundaries: 
    the land boundaries in the world total 250,883.64 km (not counting shared 
    boundaries twice) 
Coastline: 
    356,000 km 
Maritime claims: 
  contiguous zone: 
    24 nm claimed by most but can vary 
  continental shelf: 
    200-m depth claimed by most or to depth of exploitation, others claim 200 nm
 
    or to the edge of the continental margin 
  exclusive fishing zone: 
    200 nm claimed by most but can vary 
  exclusive economic zone: 
    200 nm claimed by most but can vary 
  territorial sea: 
    12 nm claimed by most but can vary 
  note: 
    boundary situations with neighboring states prevent many countries from 


    extending their fishing or economic zones to a full 200 nm; 43 nations and 
    other areas that are landlocked include Afghanistan, Andorra, Armenia, 
    Austria, Azerbaijan, Belarus, Bhutan, Bolivia, Botswana, Burkina, Burundi, 
    Central African Republic, Chad, Czech Republic, Ethiopia, Holy See (Vatican

    the Dead Sea at 392 meters below sea level; greatest ocean depth is the 
    Marianas Trench at 10,924 meters 
Natural resources: 
    the rapid using up of nonrenewable mineral resources, the depletion of 
    forest areas and wetlands, the extinction of animal and plant species, and 
    the deterioration in air and water quality (especially in Eastern Europe and
 
    the former USSR) pose serious long-term problems that governments and 
    peoples are only beginning to address

                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Led by recovery in Western Europe and strong performances by the US, Canada,
 
    and key Third World countries, real global output - gross world product 
    (GWP) - rose 3% in 1994 compared with 2% in 1993. Results varied widely 
    among regions and countries. Average growth of 3% in the GDP of 
    industrialized countries (60% of GWP in 1994) and average growth of 6% in 
    the GDP of less developed countries (34% of GWP) were partly offset by a 
    further 11% drop in the GDP of the former USSR/Eastern Europe area (now only
 
    6% of GWP). With the notable exception of Japan at 2.9%, unemployment was 
    typically 5%-12% in the industrial world. The US accounted for 22% of GWP in
 
    1994; Western Europe accounted for another 22%; and Japan accounted for 8%. 
    These are the three "economic superpowers" which are presumably destined to 
    compete for mastery in international markets on into the 21st century. As 
    for the less developed countries, China, India, and the Four Dragons - South


 
    Korea, Taiwan, Hong Kong, and Singapore - once again posted records of 5% 
    growth or better; however, many other countries, especially in Africa, 
    continued to suffer from drought, rapid population growth, inflation, and 
    civil strife. Central Europe made considerable progress in moving toward 
    "market-friendly" economies, whereas the 15 ex-Soviet countries (with the 
    notable exceptions of the three Baltic states) typically experienced further
 
    declines in output, sometimes as high as 30%. Externally, the nation-state, 
    as a bedrock economic-political institution, is steadily losing control over
 
    international flows of people, goods, funds, and technology. Internally, the
 
    central government in a number of cases is losing control over resources as 
    separatist regional movements - typically based on ethnicity - gain 
    momentum, e.g., in the successor states of the former Soviet Union, in the 
    former Yugoslavia, and in India. In Western Europe, governments face the 
    difficult political problem of channeling resources away from welfare 
    programs in order to increase investment and strengthen incentives to seek 
    employment. The addition of nearly 100 million people each year to an 
    already overcrowded globe is exacerbating the problems of pollution, 
    desertification, underemployment, epidemics, and famine. Because of their 
    own internal problems, the industrialized countries have inadequate 
    resources to deal effectively with the poorer areas of the world, which, at 
    least from the economic point of view, are becoming further marginalized. 
    (For the specific economic problems of each country, see the individual 
    country entries in this volume.) 
National product: 
    GWP (gross world product) - purchasing power parity - $30.7 trillion (1994 
    est.) 
National product real growth rate: 
    3.2% (1994 est.) 
National product per capita: 
    $5,400 (1994 est.) 
Inflation rate (consumer prices): 
  all countries: 
    25% 
  developed countries: 
    5% 
  developing countries: 
    50% (1994 est.) 
  note: 
    national inflation rates vary widely in individual cases, from stable prices
 
    to hyperinflation 
Unemployment rate: 
    30% combined unemployment and underemployment in many non-industrialized 
    countries; developed countries typically 5%-12% unemployment 
Exports: 
    $4 trillion (f.o.b., 1994 est.) 
 
                                     Economy 
  commodities: 
    the whole range of industrial and agricultural goods and services 
  partners: 
    in value, about 75% of exports from the developed countries 
Imports: 
    $4.1 trillion (c.i.f., 1994 est.) 
  commodities: 
    the whole range of industrial and agricultural goods and services 


  partners: 
    in value, about 75% of imports by the developed countries 
External debt: 
    $1 trillion for less developed countries (1993 est.) 
Industrial production: 
    growth rate 5% (1994 est.) 
Electricity: 
  capacity: 
    2,773,000,000 kW 
  production: 
    11.601 trillion kWh 
  consumption per capita: 
    1,937 kWh (1993) 
Industries: 
    industry worldwide is dominated by the onrush of technology, especially in 
    computers, robotics, telecommunications, and medicines and medical 
    equipment; most of these advances take place in OECD nations; only a small 
    portion of non-OECD countries have succeeded in rapidly adjusting to these 
    technological forces, and the technological gap between the industrial 
    nations and the less-developed countries continues to widen; the rapid 
    development of new industrial (and agricultural) technology is complicating 
    already grim environmental problems 
Agriculture: 
    the production of major food crops has increased substantially in the last 
    20 years; the annual production of cereals, for instance, has risen by 50%, 
    from about 1.2 billion metric tons to about 1.8 billion metric tons; 
    production increases have resulted mainly from increased yields rather than 
    increases in planted areas; while global production is sufficient for 
    aggregate demand, about one-fifth of the world's population remains 
    malnourished, primarily because local production cannot adequately provide 
    for large and rapidly growing populations, which are too poor to pay for 
    food imports; conditions are especially bad in Africa where drought in 
    recent years has intensified the consequences of overpopulation
