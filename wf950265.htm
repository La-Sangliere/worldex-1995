Overview: 
    Agriculture employs three-fourths of the labor force and supplies almost 40%
 
    of exports. The manufacturing sector, based on agriculture and mining, 
    produces a variety of goods and contributes 35% to GDP. Mining accounts for 
    only 5% of both GDP and employment, but minerals and metals account for 
    about 40% of exports. Severe drought caused GDP to drop 8% in 1992, with 
    growth rebounding to 2% in 1993 and 3.5% in 1994. Despite the lingering 
    effects of the drought on economic and social conditions, the government is 
    continuing to push its IMF/World Bank structural adjustment program aimed at
 
    encouraging exports and foreign investment.
