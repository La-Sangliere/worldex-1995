                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia, although the poorest republic in 
    the former Yugoslav federation, can meet basic food and energy needs through
 
    its own agricultural and coal resources. Its economic decline will continue 
    unless ties are reforged or enlarged with its neighbors Serbia and 
    Montenegro, Albania, Greece, and Bulgaria. The economy depends on outside 
    sources for all of its oil and gas and most of its modern machinery and 
    parts. An important supplement of GDP is the remittances from thousands of 
    Macedonians working in Germany and other West European nations. Continued 
    political turmoil, both internally and in the region as a whole, prevents 
    any swift readjustments of trade patterns and economic programs. The 
    country's industrial output and GDP are expected to decline further in 1995.
 
    The Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia's geographical isolation, 
    technological backwardness, and potential political instability place it far
 
    down the list of countries of interest to Western investors. Resolution of 
    the dispute with Greece and an internal commitment to economic reform would 
    encourage foreign investment over the long run. In the immediate future, the
 
    worst scenario for the economy would be the spread of fighting across its 
    borders.
