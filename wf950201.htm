    in Antarctica (but has reserved the right to do so) and does not recognize 
    the claims of any other nation 
Climate: 
    ranges from steppes in the south through humid continental in much of 
    European Russia; subarctic in Siberia to tundra climate in the polar north;

Environment: 
  current issues: 
    air pollution from heavy industry, emissions of coal-fired electric plants,

    inland waterways and sea coasts; deforestation; soil erosion; soil 
    contamination from improper application of agricultural chemicals; scattered
 
    areas of sometimes intense radioactive contamination

Note: 
    largest country in the world in terms of area but unfavorably located in 
    relation to major sea lanes of the world; despite its size, much of the 
    country lacks proper soils and climates (either too cold or too dry) for 
    agriculture

                                     Economy 
Overview: 
    Russia, a vast country with a wealth of natural resources, a well-educated 
    population, and a diverse industrial base, continues to experience 
    formidable difficulties in moving from its old centrally planned economy to 
    a modern market economy. President YEL'TSIN's government has made 
    substantial strides in converting to a market economy since launching its 
    economic reform program in January 1992 by freeing nearly all prices, 


    slashing defense spending, eliminating the old centralized distribution 
    system, completing an ambitious voucher privatization program, establishing 
    private financial institutions, and decentralizing foreign trade. Russia, 
    however, has made little progress in a number of key areas that are needed 
    to provide a solid foundation for the transition to a market economy. 
    Financial stabilization has remained elusive, with wide swings in monthly 
    inflation rates. Only limited restructuring of industry has occurred so far 
    because of a scarcity of investment funds and the failure of enterprise 
    managers to make hard cost-cutting decisions. In addition, Moscow has yet to
 
    develop a social safety net that would allow faster restructuring by 
    relieving enterprises of the burden of providing social benefits for their 
    workers and has been slow to develop the legal framework necessary to fully 
    support a market economy and to encourage foreign investment. As a result, 
    output has continued to fall. According to Russian official data, which 
    probably overstate the fall, GDP declined by 15% in 1994 compared with a 12%
 
    decline in 1993. Industrial output in 1994 fell 21% with all major sectors 
    taking a hit. Agricultural production in 1994 was down 9%. The grain harvest
 
    totaled 81 million tons, some 15 million tons less than in 1993. 
    Unemployment climbed to an estimated 6.6 million or about 7% of the work 
    force by yearend 1994. Floundering Russian firms have already had to put 
    another 4.8 million workers on involuntary, unpaid leave or shortened 
    workweeks. Government fears of large-scale unemployment continued to hamper 
    industrial restructuring efforts. According to official Russian data, real 
    per capita income was up nearly 18% in 1994 compared with 1993, in part 
    because many Russians are working second jobs. Most Russians perceive that 
    they are worse off now because of growing crime and health problems and 
    mounting wage arrears. Russia has made significant headway in privatizing 
    state assets, completing its voucher privatization program at midyear 1994. 
    At least a portion of about 110,000 state enterprises were transferred to 
    private hands by the end of 1994. Including partially privatized firms, the 
    private sector accounted for roughly half of GDP in 1994. Financial 
    stabilization continued to remain a challenge for the government. Moscow 
    tightened financial policies in late 1993 and early 1994, including 
    postponing planned budget spending, and succeeded in reducing monthly 
    inflation from 18% in January to about 5% in July and August. At midyear, 
    however, the government relaxed austerity measures in the face of mounting 
    pressure from industry and agriculture, sparking a new round of inflation; 
    the monthly inflation rate jumped to roughly 15% per month during the fourth
 
    quarter. In response, Moscow announced a fairly tight government budget for 
    1995 designed to bring monthly inflation down to around 1% by the end of 
    1995. According to official statistics, Russia's 1994 trade with nations 
    outside the former Soviet Union produced a $12.3 billion surplus, up from 
    $11.3 billion in 1993. Foreign sales - comprised largely of oil, natural 
    gas, and other raw materials - grew more than 8%. Imports also were up 8% as
 
    demand for food and other consumer goods surged. Russian trade with other 
    former Soviet republics continued to decline. At the same time, Russia paid 
    only a fraction of the roughly $20 billion in debt that came due in 1994, 
    and by the end of the year, Russia's hard currency foreign debt had risen to
 
    nearly $100 billion. Moscow reached agreement to restructure debts with 
    Paris Club official creditors in mid-1994 and concluded a preliminary deal 
    with its commercial bank creditors late in the year to reschedule debts owed
 
    them in early 1995. Capital flight continued to be a serious problem in 
    1994, with billions of additional dollars in assets being moved abroad, 


 
                                     Economy 
    primarily to bank accounts in Europe. Russia's physical plant continues to 
    deteriorate because of insufficient maintenance and new construction. Plant 
    and equipment on average are twice the age of the West's. Many years will 
    pass before Russia can take full advantage of its natural resources and its 
    human assets.

                                 Communications 
 
Telephone system: 
    24,400,000 telephones; 20,900,000 telephones in urban areas and 3,500,000 
    telephones in rural areas; of these, total installed in homes 15,400,000; 
    total pay phones for long distant calls 34,100; about 164 telephones/1,000 
    persons; Russia is enlisting foreign help, by means of joint ventures, to 
    speed up the modernization of its telecommunications system; in 1992, only 
    661,000 new telephones were installed compared with 855,000 in 1991, and in 
    1992 the number of unsatisfied applications for telephones reached 
    11,000,000; expanded access to international E-mail service available via 
    Sprint network; the inadequacy of Russian telecommunications is a severe 
    handicap to the economy, especially with respect to international 
    connections 
  local: 
    NMT-450 analog cellular telephone networks are operational and growing in 
    Moscow and St. Petersburg 
  intercity: 
    intercity fiberoptic cable installation remains limited 
  international: 
    international traffic is handled by an inadequate system of satellites, land
 
    lines, microwave radio relay and outdated submarine cables; this traffic 
    passes through the international gateway switch in Moscow which carries most
 


    of the international traffic for the other countries of the Commonwealth of 
    Independent States; a new Russian Raduga satellite will link Moscow and St. 
    Petersburg with Rome from whence calls will be relayed to destinations in 
    Europe and overseas; satellite earth stations - INTELSAT, Intersputnik, 
    Eutelsat (Moscow), INMARSAT, Orbita 
Radio: 
  broadcast stations: 
    AM 1,050, FM 1,050, shortwave 1,050 
  radios: 
    48.8 million (radio receivers with multiple speaker systems for program 
    diffusion 74,300,000)

Branches: 
    Ground Forces, Navy, Air Forces, Air Defense Forces, Strategic Rocket Forces
 
Manpower availability: 
    males age 15-49 38,264,699; males fit for military service 29,951,977; males
 
    reach military age (18) annually 1,106,176 (1995 est.) 
Defense expenditures: 
    $NA, NA% of GDP 
  note: 
    the Intelligence Community estimates that defense spending in Russia fell 
    about 15% in real terms in 1994, reducing Russian defense outlays to about 
    one-fourth of peak Soviet levels in the late 1980s; although Russia may 
    still spend as much as 10% of its GDP on defense, this is significantly 
    below the 15% to 17% burden the former USSR carried during much of the 
    1980s; conversion of military expenditures into US dollars using the current
 
    exchange rate could produce misleading results
