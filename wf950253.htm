                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Despite efforts to broaden the base of the economy, petroleum continues to 
    play a dominant role. In 1994, as GDP declined 3.3%, the oil sector - which 
    accounts for 24% of the total - enjoyed a 6% expansion, provided 45% of the 
    budget revenues, and generated 70% of the export earnings. President 
    CALDERA, who assumed office in February 1994, has used an interventionist, 
    reactive approach to managing the economy, instituting price and foreign 
    exchange controls in mid-year to slow inflation and stop the loss of foreign
 
    exchange reserves. The government claims it will remove these controls once 
    inflationary pressures abate, but the $8 billion bailout of the banking 
    sector in 1994 has made it difficult for the government to make good on its 
    promise. Economic controls, coupled with political uncertainty driven by 
    recurrent coup rumors, continue to deter foreign and domestic investment; 
    private forecasters see the recession persisting for a third year in 1995.
