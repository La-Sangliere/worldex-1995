                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Papua New Guinea is richly endowed with natural resources, but exploitation 
    has been hampered by the rugged terrain and the high cost of developing an 
    infrastructure. Agriculture provides a subsistence livelihood for 85% of the
 
    population. Mining of numerous deposits, including copper and gold, accounts
 
    for about 60% of export earnings. Budgetary support from Australia and 
    development aid under World Bank auspices have helped sustain the economy. 
    Robust growth in 1991-92 was led by the mining sector; the opening of a 
    large new gold mine helped the advance. At the start of 1995, Port Moresby 
    is looking primarily to the exploitation of mineral and petroleum resources 
    to drive economic development but new prospecting in Papua New Guinea has 
    slumped as other mineral-rich countries have stepped up their competition 
    for international investment. Output from current projects will probably 
    begin to taper off in 1996, but no new large ventures are being developed to
 
    succeed them.
