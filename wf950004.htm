Overview: 
    Economic activity is strongly linked to the US, with which American Samoa 
    conducts 80%-90% of its foreign trade. Tuna fishing and tuna processing

    export. The tuna canneries and the government are by far the two largest 
    employers. Other economic activities include a slowly developing tourist 
    industry. Transfers from the US Government add substantially to American 
    Samoa's economic well-being.
