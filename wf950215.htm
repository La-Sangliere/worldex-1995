                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Singapore has an open entrepreneurial economy with strong service and 
    manufacturing sectors and excellent international trading links derived from
 
    its entrepot history. The economy registered 10.1% growth in 1994, with 
    prospects for 7.5%-8.5% growth in 1995. In 1994, the manufacturing and 
    financial and business services sectors have led economic growth. Exports 
    boomed, led by the electronics sector, particularly US demand for disk 
    drives. Rising labor costs continue to be a threat to Singapore's 
    competitiveness, but there are indications that productivity is keeping up. 
    In applied technology, per capita output, investment, and labor discipline, 
    Singapore has key attributes of a developed country.
