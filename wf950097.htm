                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    The economy depends on agriculture, tourism, light industry, and services. 
    It is also dependent upon France for large subsidies and imports. Tourism is
 
    a key industry, with most tourists from the US. In addition, an increasingly
 
    large number of cruise ships visit the islands. The traditionally important 
    sugarcane crop is slowly being replaced by other crops, such as bananas 
    (which now supply about 50% of export earnings), eggplant, and flowers. 
    Other vegetables and root crops are cultivated for local consumption, 
    although Guadeloupe is still dependent on imported food, which comes mainly 
    from France. Light industry consists mostly of sugar and rum production. 
    Most manufactured goods and fuel are imported. Unemployment is especially 
    high among the young.
