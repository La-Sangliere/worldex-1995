                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Nepal is among the poorest and least developed countries in the world. 
    Agriculture is the mainstay of the economy, providing a livelihood for over 
    90% of the population and accounting for half of GDP. Industrial activity is
 
    limited, mainly involving the processing of agricultural produce (jute, 
    sugarcane, tobacco, and grain). Production of textiles and carpets has 
    expanded recently and accounted for 85% of foreign exchange earnings in 
    FY93/94. Apart from agricultural land and forests, exploitable natural 
    resources are mica, hydropower, and tourism. Agricultural production in the 
    late 1980s grew by about 5%, as compared with annual population growth of 
    2.6%. More than 40% of the population is undernourished. Since May 1991, the
 
    government has been encouraging trade and foreign investment, e.g., by 
    eliminating business licenses and registration requirements in order to 


    simplify domestic and foreign investment. The government also has been 
    cutting public expenditures by reducing subsidies, privatizing state 
    industries, and laying off civil servants. Prospects for foreign trade and 
    investment in the 1990s remain poor, however, because of the small size of 
    the economy, its technological backwardness, its remoteness, and 
    susceptibility to natural disaster. The international community provides 
    funding for 70% of Nepal's developmental budget and for 30% of total 
    budgetary expenditures. The government, realizing that attempts to reverse 
    three years of liberalization would jeopardize this vital support, almost 
    certainly will move ahead with its reform program in 1995-96.
