                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Australia has a prosperous Western-style capitalist economy, with a per 
    capita GDP comparable to levels in industrialized West European countries. 
    Rich in natural resources, Australia is a major exporter of agricultural 
    products, minerals, metals, and fossil fuels. Primary products account for 
    more than 60% of the value of total exports, so that, as in 1983-84, a 
    downturn in world commodity prices can have a big impact on the economy. The
 
    government is pushing for increased exports of manufactured goods, but 


    competition in international markets continues to be severe. Australia has 
    suffered from the low growth and high unemployment characterizing the OECD 
    countries in the early 1990s. In 1992-93 the economy recovered slowly from 
    the prolonged recession of 1990-91, a major restraining factor being weak 
    world demand for Australia's exports. Growth picked up so strongly in 1994 
    that the government felt the need for fiscal and monetary tightening by 
    yearend. Australia's GDP grew 6.4% in 1994, largely due to increases in 
    industrial output and business investment. A severe drought in 1994 is 
    expected to reduce the value of Australia's net farm production by $825 
    million in the twelve months through June 1995, but rising world commodity 
    prices are likely to boost rural exports by 7.7% to $14.5 billion in 
    1995/96, according to government statistics.
