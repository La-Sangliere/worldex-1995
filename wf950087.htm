Overview: 
    The Gambia has no important mineral or other natural resources and has a 
    limited agricultural base. About 75% of the population is engaged in crop 
    production and livestock raising, which contribute 30% to GDP. Small-scale 
    manufacturing activity - processing peanuts, fish, and hides - accounts for 
    less than 10% of GDP. A sustained structural adjustment program, including a
 
    liberalized trade policy, had fostered a respectable 4% rate of growth in 
    recent years. Reexport trade constitutes one-third of economic activity; 
    however, border closures associated with Senegal's monetary crisis in late 
    1993 led to a halving of reexport trade, reducing government revenues in 
    turn. The 50% devaluation of the CFA franc in January 1994 has made 
    Senegalese goods more competitive and apparently prompted a relaxation of 
    Senegalese controls, paving the way for a comeback in reexports. But 
    overwhelming these developments were the devastating effects of the 
    military's takeover in July 1994. By October, traffic at the Port of Banjul 
    had fallen precipitously as importers nervously scaled back their activities
 
    with the commencement of the anticorruption drive by the new regime. 
    Concerned with the growing potential for serious unrest after a countercoup 
    attempt was bloodily put down by the regime, the United Kingdom and the EU 
    in November issued a travelers advisory for The Gambia, which brought a halt
 
    to tourism almost immediately. The Gambia faces additional problems in 1995 
    if, as is likely, economic sanctions by Western governments remain in effect
 
    in response to indications that the military regime intends to stay in power
 
    far longer than expected by the donors.
