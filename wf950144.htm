                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    The stable, prosperous economy features moderate growth, low inflation, and 
    negligible unemployment. Agriculture is based on small but highly productive
 
    family-owned farms. The industrial sector, until recently dominated by 
    steel, has become increasingly more diversified, particularly toward 
    high-technology firms. During the past decade, growth in the financial 
    sector has more than compensated for the decline in steel. Services, 
    especially banking, account for a growing proportion of the economy. 
    Luxembourg participates in an economic union with Belgium on trade and most 
    financial matters, is also closely connected economically to the 
    Netherlands, and as a member of the 15-member European Union enjoys the 
    advantages of the open European market.
