                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Under the old Soviet central planning system, Armenia had developed a more 
    modern industrial sector, supplying machine building equipment, textiles, 
    and other manufactured goods to sister republics in exchange for raw 
    materials and energy resources. Armenia is a large food importer and its 
    mineral deposits (gold, bauxite) are small. The economic decline in recent 
    years (1991-94) has been particularly severe due to the ongoing conflict 
    over the ethnic Armenian-dominated region of Nagorno-Karabakh in Azerbaijan.
 
    Azerbaijan and Turkey have blockaded pipeline and railroad traffic to 
    Armenia for its support of the Karabakh Armenians. This has left Armenia 
    with chronic energy shortages because of a lack of capacity and frequent 
    disruptions of natural gas deliveries through unstable Georgia, as well as 
    difficulties in obtaining other types of fuel. In addition, bread is 
    strictly rationed and there are shortages of other goods. In 1994, the 
    economy seemed to bottom out. The government has managed to increase its 
    financial and budgetary discipline, bringing inflation down from around 40% 
    per month in first half 1994 to single digits in second half 1994 and the 
    first quarter of 1995. A full economic recovery cannot be expected until the
 
    conflict is settled and the blockade lifted.
