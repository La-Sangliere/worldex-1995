                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Sierra Leone has substantial mineral, agricultural, and fishery resources, 
    but the economic and social infrastructure is not well developed. 
    Agriculture generates about 40% of GDP and employs about two-thirds of the 
    working population, with subsistence agriculture dominating the sector. 
    Manufacturing, which accounts for roughly 10% of GDP, consists mainly of the
 
    processing of raw materials and of light manufacturing for the domestic 
    market. Diamond mining provides an important source of hard currency. Since 
    1990, the government has been able to meet its IMF- and World Bank-mandated 
    stabilization targets, holding down fiscal deficits, increasing foreign 
    exchange reserves, and retiring much of its domestic debt - but at a steep 
    cost in terms of capital investments and social spending. Moreover, the 
    economic infrastructure has nearly collapsed due to neglect and war-related 
    disruptions in the mining and agricultural export sectors. The continuing 
    civil war in Liberia has led to a large influx of refugees, who place 
    additional burdens on Sierra Leon's fragile economy.
