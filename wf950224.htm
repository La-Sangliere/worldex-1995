Overview: 
    Industry - dominated by the fast-growing apparel industry - has surpassed 
    agriculture as the main source of export earnings and accounts for over 16% 
    of GDP. The economy has been plagued by high rates of unemployment since the
 
    late 1970s. Economic growth, which has been depressed by ethnic unrest, 
    accelerated in 1991-94 as domestic conditions began to improve and 
    conditions for foreign investment brightened. Currently, however, the new 
    government's emphasis on populist measures has clouded Sri Lanka's economic 
    prospects.
