                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    This small poor island economy has remained dependent on cocoa since 
    independence 20 years ago. Since then, however, cocoa production has 
    gradually declined because of drought and mismanagement, so that by 1987 
    annual output had fallen from 10,000 tons to 3,900 tons. As a result, a 
    shortage of cocoa for export has created a serious balance-of-payments 
    problem. Production of less important crops, such as coffee, copra, and palm
 
    kernels, has also declined. The value of imports generally exceeds that of 
    exports by a ratio of 4:1 or more. The emphasis on cocoa production at the 
    expense of other food crops has meant that Sao Tome has to import 90% of 
    food needs. It also has to import all fuels and most manufactured goods. 
    Over the years, Sao Tome has been unable to service its external debt and 
    has had to depend on concessional aid and debt rescheduling. Considerable 
    potential exists for development of a tourist industry, and the government 
    has taken steps to expand facilities in recent years. The government also 
    has attempted to reduce price controls and subsidies and to encourage 
    market-based mechanisms, e. g., to facilitate the distribution of imported 
    food. Annual GDP growth is estimated in the 3%-4% range for 1994-96.
