                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Zaire's economy has continued to disintegrate although Prime Minister KENGO 
    has had some success in slowing the rate of economic decline. While 
    meaningful economic figures are difficult to come by, Zaire's 
    hyperinflation, chronic large government deficits, and plunging mineral 
    production have made the country one of the world's poorest. Most formal 
    transactions are conducted in hard currency as indigenous bank notes have 
    lost almost all value, and a barter economy now flourishes in all but the 
    largest cities. Most individuals and families hang on grimly through 
    subsistence farming and petty trade. The government has not been able to 
    meet its financial obligations to the International Monetary Fund or put in 
    place the financial measures advocated by the IMF. Although short-term 
    prospects for improvement are dim, improved political stability would boost 
    Zaire's long-term potential to effectively exploit its vast wealth of 
    mineral and agricultural resources.
