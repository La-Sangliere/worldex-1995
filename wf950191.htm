                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Agriculture, including forestry, accounts for about 25% of GDP, employs 
    about 45% of the labor force, and provides the bulk of exports, in which 
    soybeans and cotton are the most important. Paraguay lacks substantial 
    mineral or petroleum resources but possesses a large hydropower potential. 
    In a major step to increase its economic activity in the region, Paraguay in
 
    March 1991 joined the Southern Cone Common Market (MERCOSUR), which includes
 
    Brazil, Argentina, and Uruguay. In 1992, the government, through an 
    unorthodox approach, reduced external debt with both commercial and official
 
    creditors by purchasing a sizable amount of the delinquent commercial debt 
    in the secondary market at a substantial discount. The government had paid 
    100% of remaining official debt arrears to the US, Germany, France, and 
    Spain. All commercial debt arrears have been rescheduled. For the long run, 
    the government must press forward with general, market-oriented economic 
    reforms. Growth of 3.5% in 1993 was spurred by higher-than-expected 
    agricultural output and rising international commodity prices. Inflation 
    picked up steam in fourth quarter 1993 because of rises in public sector 
    salaries and utility rates. GDP growth continued in 1994 at 3.5%. Although 
    inflation declined a bit over 1993, increases in food prices, and crop and 
    infrastructure damage from heavy rains at the end of the year, forced 
    inflation to 18%, above the government's target of 15%. Paraguay reaffirmed 
    its commitment to MERCOSUR on 1 January 1995 by implementing the 
    organization's common external tariff.
