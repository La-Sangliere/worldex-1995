                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    In early 1995, after an impressive economic performance through most of the 
    1980s, Turkey continues to suffer through its most damaging economic crisis 
    in the last 15 years. Sparked by the downgrading in January 1994 of Turkey's
 
    international credit rating by two US credit rating agencies, the crisis 
    stems from years of loose fiscal and monetary policies that had exacerbated 
    inflation and allowed the public debt, money supply, and current account 
    deficit to explode. In April 1994, Prime Minister CILLER introduced an 
    austerity package aimed at restoring domestic and international confidence 
    in her fragile coalition government. Three months later the IMF endorsed the
 
    program, paving the way for a $740 million IMF standby loan. Although the 
    economy showed signs of improvement following the stabilization measures, 
    CILLER has been unable to overcome the political obstacles to tough 
    structural reforms necessary for sustained, longer-term growth. As a 
    consequence, the economy is suffering the worst of both worlds: at the end 
    of 1994, inflation hit a record 126% (annual rate), and real GDP dropped an 
    estimated 5% for the year as a whole, the worst decline in Turkey's post-war
 
    history. At the same time, the government missed key 1994 targets stipulated
 
    in the IMF agreement: the budget deficit is estimated to have overshot the 
    government's goal by 47%; the total public sector borrowing requirement 
    likely reached 10%-12% of GDP, rather than 8.5% called for in the program; 
    and the Turkish lira's value fell 5% to 7% more than expected. The 
    unprecedented effort by the Kurdistan Workers' Party (PKK) to raise the 
    economic costs of its insurgency against the Turkish state is adding to 
    Turkey's economic problems. Attacks against tourists have jeopardized 
    tourist revenues, which account for about 3% of GDP, while economic activity
 
    in southeastern Turkey, where most of the violence occurs, has dropped 
    considerably. Turkish officials are now negotiating a new letter of intent 
    with the IMF that will stipulate more realistic macroeconomic goals for 1995
 
    and allow the release of remaining funds of the standby agreement.
