Notes, Definitions, and Abbreviations 
 
There have been some significant changes in this edition. The Trust Territory of
 
the Pacific Islands became the independent nation of Palau. The gross domestic 
product (GDP) of all countries is now presented on a purchasing power parity 
(PPP) basis rather than on the old exchange rate basis. There is a new entry on 
Age structure and the Airports entry now includes unpaved runways.  The 
Communications category has been restructured and now includes the entries of 
Telephone system, Radio, and Television. The remainder of the entries in the 
former Communications category - Railroads, Highways, Inland waterways, 
Pipelines, Ports, Merchant marine, and Airports - can now be found under a new 
category called Transportation. There is a new appendix listing estimates of 
gross domestic product on an exchange rate basis for all nations. A reference 
map of the Republic of South Africa is included. The electronic files used to 
produce the Factbook have been restructured into a database. As a result, the 
formats of some entries in this edition have been changed. Additional changes 
will occur in the 1996 Factbook.

Administrative divisions: The numbers, designatory terms, and first-order 
administrative divisions are generally those approved by the US Board on 
Geographic Names (BGN). Changes that have been reported but not yet acted on by 
BGN are noted. 
 
Airports: Only airports with usable runways are included in this listing. For 
airports with more than one runway, only the longest runway is included. Not all
 
airports have facilities for refueling, maintenance, or air traffic control. 
Paved runways have concrete or asphalt surfaces; unpaved runways have grass, 
dirt, sand, or gravel surfaces. 
 
Area: Total area is the sum of all land and water areas delimited by 
international boundaries and/or coastlines. Land area is the aggregate of all 
surfaces delimited by international boundaries and/or coastlines, excluding 
inland water bodies (lakes, reservoirs, rivers). Comparative areas are based on 
total area equivalents. Most entities are compared with the entire US or one of 
the 50 states. The smaller entities are compared with Washington, DC (178 sq km,


 
69 sq mi) or The Mall in Washington, DC (0.59 sq km, 0.23 sq mi, 146 acres). 
 
Birth rate: The average annual number of births during a year per 1,000 
population at midyear; also known as crude birth rate. 
 
Dates of information: In general, information available as of 1 January 1995 is 
used in the preparation of this edition. Population figures are estimates for 1 
July 1995, with population growth rates estimated for calendar year 1995. Major 
political events have been updated through April 1995. 
 
Death rate: The average annual number of deaths during a year per l,000 
population at midyear; also known as crude death rate. 
 
Digraphs: The digraph is a two-letter "country code" that precisely identifies 
every entity without overlap, duplication, or omission. AF, for example, is the 
digraph for Afghanistan. It is a standardized geopolitical data element 
promulgated in the Federal Information Processing Standards Publication (FIPS) 
10-3 by the National Bureau of Standards (now called National Institute of 
Standards and Technology) at the US Department of Commerce and maintained by the
 
Office of the Geographer at the US Department of State. The digraph is used to 
eliminate confusion and incompatibility in the collection, processing, and 
dissemination of area-specific data and is particularly useful for interchanging
 
data between databases. 
 
Diplomatic representation: The US Government has diplomatic relations with 184 
nations, including 178 of the 185 UN members (excluded UN members are Bhutan, 
Cuba, Iran, Iraq, North Korea, former Yugoslavia, and the US itself). In 
addition, the US has diplomatic relations with 6 nations that are not in the UN 
- Holy See, Kiribati, Nauru, Switzerland, Tonga, and Tuvalu. 
 
Economic aid: This entry refers to bilateral commitments of official development
 
assistance (ODA) and other official flows (OOF). ODA is defined as financial 
assistance which is concessional in character, has the main objective to promote
 
economic development and welfare of LDCs, and contains a grant element of at 
least 25%. OOF transactions are also official government assistance, but with a 
main objective other than development and with a grant element less than 25%. 
OOF transactions include official export credits (such as Ex-Im Bank credits), 
official equity and portfolio investment, and debt reorganization by the 
official sector that does not meet concessional terms. Aid is considered to have
 
been committed when agreements are initialed by the parties involved and 
constitute a formal declaration of intent. 
 
Entities: Some of the nations, dependent areas, areas of special sovereignty, 
and governments included in this publication are not independent, and others are
 
not officially recognized by the US Government. "Nation" refers to a people 
politically organized into a sovereign state with a definite territory. 
"Dependent area" refers to a broad category of political entities that are 
associated in some way with a nation. Names used for page headings are usually 
the short-form names as approved by the US Board on Geographic Names. There are 
266 entities in The World Factbook that may be categorized as follows:

Exchange rate: The official value of a nation's monetary unit at a given date or
 
over a given period of time, as expressed in units of local currency per US 
dollar and as determined by international market forces or official fiat. 
 
GDP methodology: In the "Economy" section, GDP dollar estimates for all 


countries are derived from purchasing power parity (PPP) calculations rather 
than from conversions at official currency exchange rates. The PPP method 
normally involves the use of international dollar price weights, which are 
applied to the quantities of goods and services produced in a given economy. In 
addition to the lack of reliable data from the majority of countries, the 
statistician faces a major difficulty in specifying, identifying, and allowing 
for the quality of goods and services. The division of a GDP estimate in local 
currency by the corresponding PPP estimate in dollars gives the PPP conversion 
rate. On average, one thousand dollars will buy the same market basket of goods 
in the US as one thousand dollars - converted to the local currency at the PPP 
conversion rate - will buy in the other country.  Whereas PPP estimates for OECD
 
countries are quite reliable, PPP estimates for developing countries are often 
rough approximations.  Most of the GDP estimates are based on extrapolation of 
numbers published by the UN International Comparison Program and by Professors 
Robert Summers and Alan Heston of the University of Pennsylvania and their 
colleagues. Currency exchange rates depend on a variety of international and 
domestic financial forces that often have little relation to domestic output. In
 
developing countries with weak currencies the exchange rate estimate of GDP in 
dollars is typically one-fourth to one-half the PPP estimate. Furthermore, 
exchange rates may suddenly go up or down by 10% or more because of market 
forces or official fiat whereas real output has remained unchanged. On 12 
January 1994, for example, the 14 countries of the African Financial Community 
(whose currencies are tied to the French franc) devalued their currencies by 
50%. This move, of course, did not cut the real output of these countries by 
half. One important caution: the proportion of, say, defense expenditures as a 
percentage of GDP in local currency accounts may differ substantially from the 
proportion when GDP accounts are expressed in PPP terms, as, for example, when 
an observer tries to estimate the dollar level of Russian or Japanese military 
expenditures. Note: The numbers for GDP and other economic data can not be 
chained together from successive volumes of the Factbook because of changes in 
the US dollar measuring rod, revisions of data by statistical agencies, use of 
new or different sources of information, and changes in national statistical 
methods and practices. 
 
Gross domestic product (GDP): The value of all final goods and services produced
 
within a nation in a given year. 
 
Gross national product (GNP): The value of all final goods and services produced
 
within a nation in a given year, plus income earned abroad, minus income earned 
by foreigners from domestic production. 
 
Gross world product (GWP): The aggregate value of all goods and services 
produced worldwide in a given year. 
 
Growth rate (population): The annual percent change in the population, resulting
 
from a surplus (or deficit) of births over deaths and the balance of migrants 
entering and leaving a country. The rate may be positive or negative. 
 
Illicit drugs: There are five categories of illicit drugs - narcotics, 
stimulants, depressants (sedatives), hallucinogens, and cannabis. These 
categories include many drugs legally produced and prescribed by doctors as well
 
as those illegally produced and sold outside medical channels. 
 
Cannabis (Cannabis sativa) is the common hemp plant, which provides 


hallucinogens with some sedative properties, and includes marijuana (pot, 
Acapulco gold, grass, reefer), tetrahydrocannabinol (THC, Marinol), hashish 
(hash), and hashish oil (hash oil). 
 
Coca (Erythroxylum coca) is a bush, and the leaves contain the stimulant used to
 
make cocaine. Coca is not to be confused with cocoa, which comes from cacao 
seeds and is used in making chocolate, cocoa, and cocoa butter. 
 
Cocaine is a stimulant derived from the leaves of the coca bush. 
 
Depressants (sedatives) are drugs that reduce tension and anxiety and include 
chloral hydrate, barbiturates (Amytal, Nembutal, Seconal, phenobarbital), 
benzodiazepines (Librium, Valium), methaqualone (Quaalude), glutethimide 
(Doriden), and others (Equanil, Placidyl, Valmid). 
 
Drugs are any chemical substances that effect a physical, mental, emotional, or 
behavioral change in an individual. 
 
Drug abuse is the use of any licit or illicit chemical substance that results in
 
physical, mental, emotional, or behavioral impairment in an individual. 
 
Hallucinogens are drugs that affect sensation, thinking, self-awareness, and 
emotion. Hallucinogens include LSD (acid, microdot), mescaline and peyote (mexc,
 
buttons, cactus), amphetamine variants (PMA, STP, DOB), phencyclidine (PCP, 
angel dust, hog), phencyclidine analogues (PCE, PCPy, TCP), and others 
(psilocybin, psilocyn). 
 
Hashish is the resinous exudate of the cannabis or hemp plant (Cannabis sativa).
 
 
Heroin is a semisynthetic derivative of morphine. 
 
Mandrax is the Southwest Asian slang term for methaqualone, a pharmaceutical 
depressant. 
 
Marijuana is the dried leaves of the cannabis or hemp plant (Cannabis sativa). 
 
Methaqualone is a pharmaceutical depressant, in slang referred to as Quaaludes 
in North America or Mandrax in Southwest Asia 
 
Narcotics are drugs that relieve pain, often induce sleep, and refer to opium, 
opium derivatives, and synthetic substitutes. Natural narcotics include opium 
(paregoric, parepectolin), morphine (MS-Contin, Roxanol), codeine (Tylenol with 
codeine, Empirin with codeine, Robitussan AC), and thebaine. Semisynthetic 
narcotics include heroin (horse, smack), and hydromorphone (Dilaudid). Synthetic
 
narcotics include meperidine or Pethidine (Demerol, Mepergan), methadone 
(Dolophine, Methadose), and others (Darvon, Lomotil). 
 
Opium is the milky exudate of the incised, unripe seedpod of the opium poppy. 
 
Opium poppy (Papaver somniferum) is the source for many natural and 
semisynthetic narcotics. 
 
Poppy straw concentrate is the alkaloid derived from the mature dried opium 
poppy. 
 


Qat (kat, khat) is a stimulant from the buds or leaves of catha edulis that is 
chewed or drunk as tea. 
 
Quaaludes is the North American slang term for methaqualone, a pharmaceutical 
depressant. 
 
Stimulants are drugs that relieve mild depression, increase energy and activity,
 
and include cocaine (coke, snow, crack), amphetamines (Desoxyn, Dexedrine), 
phenmetrazine (Preludin), methylphenidate (Ritalin), and others (Cylert, 
Sanorex, Tenuate). 
 
Infant mortality rate: The number of deaths to infants under one year old in a 
given year per l,000 live births occurring in the same year. 
 
International disputes: This category includes a wide variety of situations that
 
range from traditional bilateral boundary disputes to unilateral claims of one 
sort or another. Information regarding disputes over international boundaries 
and maritime boundaries has been reviewed by the Department of State. References
 
to other situations involving borders or frontiers may also be included, such as
 
resource disputes, geopolitical questions, or irredentist issues. However, 
inclusion does not necessarily constitute official acceptance or recognition by 
the US Government. 
 
Irrigated land: The figure refers to the land area that is artificially supplied
 
with water. 
 
Land use: The land surface is categorized as arable land - land cultivated for 
crops that are replanted after each harvest (wheat, maize, rice);  permanent 
crops - land cultivated for crops that are not replanted after each harvest 
(citrus, coffee, rubber); meadows and pastures - land permanently used for 
herbaceous forage crops; forest and woodland - under dense or open stands of 
trees; and other - any land type not specifically mentioned above (urban areas, 
roads, desert). 
 
Leaders: The chief of state is the titular leader of the country who represents 
the state at official and ceremonial functions but is not involved with the day-
 
to-day activities of the government. The head of government is the 
administrative leader who manages the day-to-day activities of the government. 
In the UK, the monarch is the chief of state, and the Prime Minister is the head
 
of government. In the US, the President is both the chief of state and the head 
of government. 
 
Life expectancy at birth: The average number of years to be lived by a group of 
people all born in the same year, if mortality at each age remains constant in 
the future. 
 
Literacy: There are no universal definitions and standards of literacy. Unless 
otherwise noted, all rates are based on the most common definition - the ability
 
to read and write at a specified age. Detailing the standards that individual 
countries use to assess the ability to read and write is beyond the scope of 
this publication. 
 


Maritime claims: The proximity of neighboring states may prevent some national 
claims from being extended the full distance. 
 
Merchant marine: All ships engaged in the carriage of goods. All commercial 
vessels (as opposed to all nonmilitary ships), which excludes tugs, fishing 
vessels, offshore oil rigs, etc. Also, a grouping of merchant ships by 
nationality or register. 
 
Captive register - A register of ships maintained by a territory, possession, or
 
colony primarily or exclusively for the use of ships owned in the parent 
country; also referred to as an offshore register, the offshore equivalent of an
 
internal register. Ships on a captive register will fly the same flag as the 
parent country, or a local variant of it, but will be subject to the maritime 
laws and taxation rules of the offshore territory. Although the nature of a 
captive register makes it especially desirable for ships owned in the parent 
country, just as in the internal register, the ships may also be owned abroad. 
The captive register then acts as a flag of convenience register, except that it
 
is not the register of an independent state. 
 
Flag of convenience register - A national register offering registration to a 
merchant ship not owned in the flag state. The major flags of convenience (FOC) 
attract ships to their registers by virtue of low fees, low or nonexistent 
taxation of profits, and liberal manning requirements. True FOC registers are 
characterized by having relatively few of the ships registered actually owned in
 
the flag state. Thus, while virtually any flag can be used for ships under a 
given set of circumstances, an FOC register is one where the majority of the 
merchant fleet is owned abroad. It is also referred to as an open register. 
 
Flag state - The nation in which a ship is registered and which holds legal 
jurisdiction over operation of the ship, whether at home or abroad. Flag state 
maritime legislation determines how a ship is manned and taxed and whether a 
foreign-owned ship may be placed on the register. 
 
Internal register - A register of ships maintained as a subset of a national 
register. Ships on the internal register fly the national flag and have that 
nationality but are subject to a separate set of maritime rules from those on 
the main national register. These differences usually include lower taxation of 
profits, manning by foreign nationals, and, usually, ownership outside the flag 
state (when it functions as an FOC register). The Norwegian International Ship 
Register and Danish International Ship Register are the most notable examples of
 
an internal register. Both have been instrumental in stemming flight from the 
national flag to flags of convenience and in attracting foreign owned ships to 
the Norwegian and Danish flags. 
 
Merchant ship - A vessel that carries goods against payment of freight; commonly
 
used to denote any nonmilitary ship but accurately restricted to commercial 
vessels only. 
 
Register - The record of a ship's ownership and nationality as listed with the 
maritime authorities of a country; also, the compendium of such individual 
ships' registrations. Registration of a ship provides it with a nationality and 
makes it subject to the laws of the country in which registered (the flag state)
 
regardless of the nationality of the ship's ultimate owner. 


 
Money figures: All money figures are expressed in contemporaneous US dollars 
unless otherwise indicated. 
 
National product: The total output of goods and services in a country in a given
 
year. See GDP methodology, Gross domestic product (GDP), and Gross national 
product (GNP). 
 
Net migration rate: The balance between the number of persons entering and 
leaving a country during the year per 1,000 persons (based on midyear 
population). An excess of persons entering the country is referred to as net 
immigration (3.56 migrants/1,000 population); an excess of persons leaving the 
country as net emigration (-9.26 migrants/1,000 population). 
 
Population: Figures are estimates from the Bureau of the Census based on 
statistics from population censuses, vital statistics registration systems, or 
sample surveys pertaining to the recent past, and on assumptions about future 
trends. Starting with the 1993 Factbook, demographic estimates for some 
countries (mostly African) have taken into account the effects of the growing 
incidence of AIDS infections; in 1993 these countries were Burkina, Burundi, 
Central African Republic, Congo, Cote d'Ivoire, Kenya, Malawi, Rwanda, Tanzania,
 
Uganda, Zaire, Zambia, Zimbabwe, Thailand, Brazil, and Haiti. 
 
Telephone numbers: All telephone numbers presented in the Factbook consist of 
the country code in brackets, the city or area code (where required) in 
parentheses, and the local number. The one component that is not presented is 
the international access code which varies from country to country. For example,
 
an international direct dial phone call placed from the United States to Madrid,
 
Spain, would be as follows: 
 
             011 [34] (1) 577-xxxx where 
 
             011 is the international access code for station-to-station calls 
                (01 is for calls other than station-to-station calls), 
             [34] is the country code for Spain, 
             (1) is the city code for Madrid, 
             577 is the local exchange, 
         and xxxx is the local telephone number. 
An international direct dial phone call placed from another country to the 
United States would be as follows: 
 
             international access code + [1] (202) 939-xxxx where 
 
                   [1] is the country code for the United States, 
                   (202) is the area code for Washington, DC, 
                   939 is the local exchange, 
            and xxxx is the local telephone number. 
 
Total fertility rate: The average number of children that would be born per 
woman if all women lived to the end of their childbearing years and bore 
children according to a given fertility rate at each age. 
 
Years: All year references are for the calendar year (CY) unless indicated as 
fiscal year (FY). FY93/94 refers to the fiscal year that began in calendar year 
1993 and ended in calendar year 1994 as defined in the Fiscal Year entry of the 
Economy section for each nation. FY90-94 refers to the four fiscal years that 


began in calendar year 1990 and ended in calendar year 1994. 
 
Note: Information for the US and US dependencies was compiled from material in 
the public domain and does not represent Intelligence Community estimates. The 
Handbook of International Economic Statistics, published annually in September 
by the Central Intelligence Agency, contains detailed economic information for 
the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries, 
Eastern Europe, the newly independent republics of the former nations of 
Yugoslavia and the Soviet Union, and selected other countries. The Handbook can 
be obtained wherever The World Factbook is available.
