                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    The economy is based on subsistence agriculture, which occupies more than 
    60% of the population and contributes nearly 25% to GDP. Manufacturing, 
    which includes a number of agroprocessing factories, accounts for another 
    quarter of GDP. Mining has declined in importance in recent years; 
    high-grade iron ore deposits were depleted by 1978, and health concerns cut 
    world demand for asbestos. Exports of sugar and forestry products are the 
    main earners of hard currency. Surrounded by South Africa, except for a 
    short border with Mozambique, Swaziland is heavily dependent on South 
    Africa, from which it receives 90% of its imports and to which it sends 
    about half of its exports. Remittances from Swazi workers in South African 
    mines may supplement domestically produced income by as much as 20%.
