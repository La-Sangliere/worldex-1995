                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Revenues come from the export of phosphates, the reserves of which are 
    expected to be exhausted by the year 2000. Phosphates have given Nauruans 
    one of the highest per capita incomes in the Third World. Few other 
    resources exist, so most necessities must be imported, including fresh water
 
    from Australia. The rehabilitation of mined land and the replacement of 
    income from phosphates are serious long-term problems. Substantial amounts 
    of phosphate income are invested in trust funds to help cushion the 
    transition.
