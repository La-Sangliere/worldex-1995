    two equal width horizontal bands of red (top) and blue separated by a

    which the arms are separated by narrow yellow bands; the red and blue bands 
    are separated from the green band and its arms by narrow white stripes 
  note: 
    prior to 26 April 1994, the flag was actually four flags in one - three 
    miniature flags reproduced in the center of the white band of the former 
    flag of the Netherlands, which has three equal horizontal bands of orange 
    (top), white, and blue; the miniature flags are a vertically hanging flag of
 
    the old Orange Free State with a horizontal flag of the UK adjoining on the

    the other side 
 
                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Many of the white one-seventh of the South African population enjoy incomes,
 
    material comforts, and health and educational standards equal to those of 
    Western Europe. In contrast, most of the remaining population suffers from 
    the poverty patterns of the Third World, including unemployment and lack of 
    job skills. The main strength of the economy lies in its rich mineral 
    resources, which provide two-thirds of exports. Economic developments for 
    the remainder of the 1990s will be driven largely by the new government's 
    attempts to improve black living conditions, to set the country on an 
    aggressive export-led growth path, and to cut back the enormous numbers of 
    unemployed. The economy in recent years has absorbed less than 5% of the 
    more than 300,000 workers entering the labor force annually. Local 
    economists estimate that the economy must grow between 5% and 6% in real 
    terms annually to absorb all of the new entrants, much less reduce the 
    accumulated total.
