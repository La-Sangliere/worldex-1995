                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    With independence from Ethiopia on 27 April 1993, Eritrea faces the bitter 
    economic problems of a small, desperately poor African country. Most of the 
    population will continue to depend on subsistence farming. Domestic output 
    is substantially augmented by worker remittances from abroad. Government 
    revenues come from custom duties and income and sales taxes. Eritrea has 
    inherited the entire coastline of Ethiopia and has long-term prospects for 
    revenues from the development of offshore oil, offshore fishing, and 
    tourism. For the time being, Ethiopia will be largely dependent on Eritrean 
    ports for its foreign trade.
