                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Five years after the fall of the Berlin Wall, progress towards economic 


    integration between eastern and western Germany is clearly visible, yet the 
    eastern region almost certainly will remain dependent on subsidies funded by
 
    western Germany until well into the next century. The staggering $390 
    billion in western German assistance that the eastern states have received 
    since 1990 - 40 times the amount in real terms of US Marshall Fund aid sent 
    to West Germany after World War II - is just beginning to have an impact on 
    the eastern German standard of living, which plummeted after unification. 
    Assistance to the east continues to run at roughly $100 billion annually. 
    Although the growth rate in the east was much greater than in the west in 
    1993-94, eastern GDP per capita nonetheless remains well below 
    preunification levels; it will take 10-15 years for the eastern states to 
    match western Germany's living standards. The economic recovery in the east 
    is led by the construction industries which account for one-third of 
    industrial output, with growth increasingly supported by the service sectors
 
    and light manufacturing industries. Eastern Germany's economy is changing 
    from one anchored on manufacturing to a more service-oriented economy. 
    Western Germany, with three times the per capita output of the eastern 
    states, has an advanced market economy and is a world leader in exports. The
 
    strong recovery in 1994 from recession began in the export sector and spread
 
    to the investment and consumption sectors in response to falling interest 
    rates. Western Germany has a highly urbanized and skilled population that 
    enjoys excellent living standards, abundant leisure time, and comprehensive 
    social welfare benefits. It is relatively poor in natural resources, coal 
    being the most important mineral. Western Germany's world-class companies 
    manufacture technologically advanced goods. The region's economy is mature: 
    services and manufacturing account for the dominant share of economic 
    activities, and raw materials and semimanufactured goods constitute a large 
    portion of imports.
