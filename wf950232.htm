Note: 
    Tajikistan has experienced three changes of government since it gained 
    independence in September 1991. The current president, Emomali RAKHMONOV, 
    was elected to the presidency in November 1994, yet has been in power since 
    1992. The country is suffering through its third year of a civil war, with 
    no clear end in sight. Underlying the conflict are deeply-rooted regional 
    and clan-based animosities that pit a government consisting of people 
    primarily from the Kulob (Kulyab), Khujand (Leninabad), and Hisor (Hissar) 
    regions against a secular and Islamic-led opposition from the Gharm, 
    Gorno-Badakhshan, and Qurghonteppa (Kurgan-Tyube) regions. Government and 
    opposition representatives have held periodic rounds of UN-mediated peace 
    talks and agreed in September 1994 to a cease-fire. Russian-led peacekeeping
 
    troops are deployed throughout the country, and Russian border guards are 
    stationed along the Tajik-Afghan border.

                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Tajikistan had the next-to-lowest per capita GDP in the former USSR, the 
    highest rate of population growth, and an extremely low standard of living. 
    Agriculture dominates the economy, cotton being the most important crop. 
    Mineral resources, varied but limited in amount, include silver, gold, 
    uranium, and tungsten. Industry is limited to a large aluminum plant, 
    hydropower facilities, and small obsolete factories mostly in light industry
 
    and food processing. The Tajik economy has been gravely weakened by three 
    years of civil war and by the loss of subsidies and markets for its 
    products, which has left Tajikistan dependent on Russia and Uzbekistan and 
    on international humanitarian assistance for much of its basic subsistence 
    needs. Moreover, constant political turmoil and the continued dominance by 
    former Communist officials have impeded the introduction of meaningful 
    economic reforms. In the meantime, Tajikistan's efforts to adopt the Russian
 
    ruble as its domestic currency despite Russia's unwillingness to supply 
    sufficient rubles left the country in a severe monetary crisis throughout 
    1994, keeping inflation low but leaving workers and pensioners unpaid for 
    months at a time. The government has announced plans to introduce its own 
    currency in 1995 to help resolve the problem.

    GDP - purchasing power parity - $8.5 billion (1994 estimate as extrapolated

    scale development loans await IMF approval of a reform and stabilization
