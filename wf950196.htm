                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Portugal's economy contracted 0.4% in 1993 but registered a 1.4% growth in 
    1994, with 3% growth expected in 1995 and 1996. This comeback rests on high 
    levels of public investment, continuing strong export growth, and a gradual 
    recovery in consumer spending. The government's long-run economic goal is 
    the modernization of Portuguese markets, industry, infrastructure, and work 
    force in order to catch up with productivity and income levels of the more 
    advanced EU countries. Per capita income now equals only 55% of the EU 
    average. Economic policy in 1994 focused on reducing inflationary pressures 
    by lowering the fiscal deficit, maintaining a stable escudo, moderating wage
 
    increases, and encouraging increased competition. The government's 
    medium-term objective is to be in the first tier of the EU countries 
    eligible to join the economic and monetary union (EMU) as early as 1997. To 
    this end, the 1995 budget posits a cut in total deficit to 5.8% of GDP.
