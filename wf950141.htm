                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    The socialist-oriented economy depends primarily upon revenues from the oil 
    sector, which contributes practically all export earnings and about 
    one-third of GDP. In 1990 per capita GDP was the highest in Africa at 
    $5,410, but GDP growth rates have slowed and fluctuated sharply in response 
    to changes in the world oil market. Import restrictions and inefficient 


    resource allocations have led to periodic shortages of basic goods and 
    foodstuffs. Windfall revenues from the hike in world oil prices in late 1990
 
    improved the foreign payments position and resulted in a current account 
    surplus through 1992. The nonoil manufacturing and construction sectors, 
    which account for about 20% of GDP, have expanded from processing mostly 
    agricultural products to include petrochemicals, iron, steel, and aluminum. 
    Although agriculture accounts for only 5% of GDP, it employs 18% of the 
    labor force. Climatic conditions and poor soils severely limit farm output, 
    and Libya imports about 75% of its food requirements. The UN sanctions 
    imposed in April 1992 have not yet had a major impact on the economy because
 
    Libya's oil revenues generate sufficient foreign exchange which sustains 
    imports of food, consumer goods, and equipment for the oil industry and 
    ongoing development projects.
