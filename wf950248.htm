                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    The UK is one of the world's great trading powers and financial centers, and
 
    its economy ranks among the four largest in Western Europe. The economy is 
    essentially capitalistic; over the past 13 years the ruling Tories have 
    greatly reduced public ownership and contained the growth of social welfare 
    programs. Agriculture is intensive, highly mechanized, and efficient by 
    European standards, producing about 60% of food needs with only 1% of the 
    labor force. The UK has large coal, natural gas, and oil reserves, and 
    primary energy production accounts for 12% of GDP, one of the highest shares
 
    of any industrial nation. Services, particularly banking, insurance, and 
    business services, account by far for the largest proportion of GDP while 
    industry continues to decline in importance, now employing only 25% of the 
    work force and generating only 21% of GDP. The economy registered 4.2% GDP 
    growth in 1994, its fastest annual rate for six years. Exports and 
    manufacturing output are the primary engines of growth. Unemployment is 
    gradually falling. Inflation is at the lowest level in 27 years, but British
 
    monetary authorities raised interest rates to 6.25% in 1994 in a preemptive 
    strike on emerging inflationary pressures such as higher taxes and rising 
    manufacturing costs. The combination of a buoyant economy and fiscal 


    tightening is projected to trim the FY94/95 budget shortfall to about $50 
    billion - down from about $75 billion in FY93/94. The major economic policy 
    question for Britain in the 1990s is the terms on which it participates in 
    the financial and economic integration of Europe.
