                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Beginning in late 1978 the Chinese leadership has been trying to move the 
    economy from the sluggish Soviet-style centrally planned economy to a more 
    productive and flexible economy with market elements, but still within the 
    framework of monolithic Communist control. To this end the authorities 
    switched to a system of household responsibility in agriculture in place of 
    the old collectivization, increased the authority of local officials and 
    plant managers in industry, permitted a wide variety of small-scale 
    enterprise in services and light manufacturing, and opened the economy to 
    increased foreign trade and investment. The result has been a strong surge 
    in production, particularly in agriculture in the early 1980s. Industry also
 
    has posted major gains, especially in coastal areas near Hong Kong and 
    opposite Taiwan, where foreign investment and modern production methods have
 
    helped spur production of both domestic and export goods. Aggregate output 
    has more than doubled since 1978. On the darker side, the leadership has 
    often experienced in its hybrid system the worst results of socialism 
    (bureaucracy, lassitude, corruption) and of capitalism (windfall gains and 
    stepped-up inflation). Beijing thus has periodically backtracked, 
    retightening central controls at intervals. In 1992-94 annual growth of GDP 
    accelerated, particularly in the coastal areas - to more than 10% annually 
    according to official claims. In late 1993 China's leadership approved 
    additional long-term reforms aimed at giving more play to market-oriented 
    institutions and at strengthening the center's control over the financial 
    system. In 1994 strong growth continued in the widening market-oriented 
    areas of the economy. At the same time, the government struggled to (a) 
    collect revenues due from provinces, businesses, and individuals; (b) keep 
    inflation within bounds; (c) reduce extortion and other economic crimes; and
 
    (d) keep afloat the large state-owned enterprises, most of which had not 
    participated in the vigorous expansion of the economy. From 60 to 100 
    million surplus rural workers are adrift between the villages and the 
    cities, many barely subsisting through part-time low-pay jobs. Popular 
    resistance, changes in central policy, and loss of authority by rural cadres
 
    have weakened China's population control program, which is essential to the 
    nation's long-term economic viability. One of the most dangerous long-term 
    threats to continued rapid economic growth is the deterioration in the 
    environment, notably air pollution, soil erosion, and the steady fall of the
 
    water table especially in the north. 
National product:
