Overview: 
    Tiny in area, Bahrain is well-to-do in economic resources and per capita 
    income. Petroleum production and processing account for about 80% of export 
    receipts, 60% of government revenues, and 30% of GDP. Economic conditions 
    have fluctuated with the changing fortunes of oil since 1985, for example, 
    during and following the Gulf crisis of 1990-91. With its highly developed 
    communication and transport facilities Bahrain is home to numerous 
    multinational firms with business in the Gulf. A large share of exports 
    consists of petroleum products made from imported crude. Prospects for 1995 
    are good, with private enterprise the main driving force, e.g., in banking 
    and construction. Unemployment, especially among the young, and the 
    depletion of both oil and underground water resources are major long-term 
    economic problems.
