    pesticides and natural salts; these substances are then blown from the 
    increasingly exposed lake bed and contribute to desertification; water 
    pollution from industrial wastes and the heavy use of fertilizers and

                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Uzbekistan is a dry, landlocked country of which 10% consists of intensely 
    cultivated, irrigated river valleys. It is one of the poorest states of the 
    former USSR with 60% of its population living in overpopulated rural 
    communities. Nevertheless, Uzbekistan is the world's third largest cotton 
    exporter, a major producer of gold and natural gas, and a regionally 
    significant producer of chemicals and machinery. Since independence, the 


    government has sought to prop up the Soviet-style command economy with 
    subsidies and tight controls on prices and production. Such policies have 
    buffered the economy from the sharp declines in output and high inflation 
    experienced by many other former Soviet republics. They had become 
    increasingly unsustainable, however, as inflation moves along at 14% per 
    month and as Russia has forced the Uzbek government to introduce its own 
    currency. Faced with mounting economic problems, the government has begun to
 
    move on a reform agenda and cooperate with international financial 
    institutions, announced an acceleration of privatization, and stepped up 
    efforts to attract foreign investors. Nevertheless, the regime is likely to 
    find it difficult to sustain its drive for economic reform.
