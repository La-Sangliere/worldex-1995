                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    The UAE has an open economy with one of the world's highest incomes per 
    capita and with a sizable annual trade surplus. Its wealth is based on oil 
    and gas output (about 40% of GDP), and the fortunes of the economy fluctuate
 
    with the prices of those commodities. Since 1973, the UAE has undergone a 
    profound transformation from an impoverished region of small desert 
    principalities to a modern state with a high standard of living. At present 
    levels of production, crude oil reserves should last for over 100 years. 
    Although much stronger economically than most Gulf states, the UAE faces 
    similar problems with weak international oil prices and the pressures for 
    cuts in OPEC oil production quotas. The UAE government is encouraging 
    increased privatization within the economy.
