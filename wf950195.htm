Overview: 
    Poland continues to make good progress in the difficult transition to a 
    market economy that began on 1 January 1990, when the new democratic 
    government instituted "shock therapy" by decontrolling prices, slashing 
    subsidies, and drastically reducing import barriers. Real GDP fell sharply 
    in 1990 and 1991, but in 1992 Poland became the first country in the region 


    to resume economic growth with a 2.6% increase. Growth increased to 3.8% in 
    1993 and 5.5% in 1994 - the highest rate in Europe except for Albania. All 
    of the growth since 1991 has come from the booming private sector, which now
 
    accounts for at least 55% of GDP, even though privatization of the 
    state-owned enterprises is proceeding slowly and most industry remains in 
    state hands. Industrial production increased 12% in 1994 - led by 50% jumps 
    in the output of motor vehicles, radios and televisions, and pulp and paper 
    - and is now well above the 1990 level. Inflation, which had approached 
    1,200% annually in early 1990, was down to about 30% in 1994, as the 
    government held the budget deficit to 1.5% of GDP. After five years of 
    steady increases, unemployment has leveled off at about 16% nationwide, 
    although it approaches 30% in some regions. The trade deficit was sharply 
    reduced in 1994, due mainly to increased exports to Western Europe, Poland's
 
    main customer. The leftist government elected in September 1993 gets 
    generally good marks from foreign observers for its management of the budget
 
    but is often criticized for not moving faster on privatization.
