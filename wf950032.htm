Note: 
    Bosnia and Herzegovina is set to enter its third year of interethnic civil 
    strife which began in the spring of 1992 after the Government of Bosnia and 
    Herzegovina held a referendum on independence. Bosnia's Serbs - supported by
 
    neighboring Serbia - responded with armed resistance aimed at partitioning 
    the republic along ethnic lines and joining Serb-held areas to 'greater 
    Serbia'. In March 1994, Bosnia's Muslims and Croats reduced the number of 
    warring factions from three to two by signing an agreement in Washington, 
    DC, creating the Federation of Bosnia and Herzegovina. A group of rebel 
    Muslims, however, continues to battle government forces in the northwest 
    enclave of Bihac. A Contact Group of countries, the US, UK, France, Germany,
 
    and Russia, continues to seek a resolution between the Federation and the 
    Bosnian Serbs. In July of 1994 the Contact Group presented a plan to the 
    warring parties that roughly equally divides the country between the two, 
    while maintaining Bosnia in its current internationally recognized borders. 
    The Federation agreed to the plan almost immediately, while the Bosnian 


    Serbs rejected it.

    January 1; the Bosnian Serbs continue to reject the Contact Group Plan 
    submitted by the United States, United Kingdom, France, Germany, and Russia,
 
    and accepted by the Bosnian Government, which stands firm in its desire to 
    regain lost territory and preserve Bosnia as a multiethnic state within its 
    current borders; Bosnian Serb forces control approximately 70% of Bosnian

Overview: 
    Bosnia and Herzegovina ranked next to The Former Yugoslav Republic of 
    Macedonia as the poorest republic in the old Yugoslav federation. Although 
    agriculture has been almost all in private hands, farms have been small and 
    inefficient, and the republic traditionally has been a net importer of food.
 
    Industry has been greatly overstaffed, one reflection of the rigidities of 
    Communist central planning and management. TITO had pushed the development 
    of military industries in the republic with the result that Bosnia hosted a 
    large share of Yugoslavia's defense plants. As of February 1995, Bosnia and 
    Herzegovina was being torn apart by the continued bitter interethnic warfare
 
    that has caused production to plummet, unemployment and inflation to soar, 
    and human misery to multiply. No economic statistics for 1992-94 are 
    available, although output clearly has fallen substantially below the levels
 
    of earlier years and almost certainly is well below $1,000 per head. The 
    country receives substantial amounts of humanitarian aid from the 
    international community.

Agriculture: 
    accounted for 9.0% of GDP in 1989; regularly produces less than 50% of food 
    needs; the foothills of northern Bosnia support orchards, vineyards, 
    livestock, and some wheat and corn; long winters and heavy precipitation 
    leach soil fertility reducing agricultural output in the mountains; farms
