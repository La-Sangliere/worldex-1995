Note: 
    Lebanon has made progress toward rebuilding its political institutions and 
    regaining its national sovereignty since the end of the devastating 16-year 
    civil war which began in 1975. Under the Ta'if accord - the blueprint for 
    national reconciliation - the Lebanese have established a more equitable 
    political system, particularly by giving Muslims a greater say in the 
    political process. Since December 1990, the Lebanese have formed three 
    cabinets and conducted the first legislative election in 20 years. Most of 
    the militias have been weakened or disbanded. The Lebanese Armed Forces 
    (LAF) has seized vast quantities of weapons used by the militias during the 
    war and extended central government authority over about one-half of the 
    country. Hizballah, the radical Sh'ia party, retains most of its weapons. 
    Foreign forces still occupy areas of Lebanon. Israel maintains troops in 
    southern Lebanon and continues to support a proxy militia, The Army of South
 
    Lebanon (ASL), along a narrow stretch of territory contiguous to its border.
 
    The ASL's enclave encompasses this self-declared security zone and about 20 
    kilometers north to the strategic town of Jazzine. As of December 1993, 
    Syria maintained about 30,000-35,000 troops in Lebanon. These troops are 
    based mainly in Beirut, North Lebanon, and the Bekaa Valley. Syria's 
    deployment was legitimized by the Arab League early in Lebanon's civil war 
    and in the Ta'if accord. Citing the continued weakness of the LAF, Beirut's 
    requests, and failure of the Lebanese Government to implement all of the 
    constitutional reforms in the Ta'if accord, Damascus has so far refused to 
    withdraw its troops from Beirut.

                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    The 1975-1991 civil war seriously damaged Lebanon's economic infrastructure,
 
    cut national output by half, and all but ended Lebanon's position as a 
    Middle Eastern entrepot and banking hub. A tentative peace has enabled the 
    central government to begin restoring control in Beirut, collect taxes, and 
    regain access to key port and government facilities. The battered economy 
    has also been propped up by a financially sound banking system and resilient
 
    small- and medium-scale manufacturers. Family remittances, banking 
    transactions, manufactured and farm exports, the narcotics trade, and 
    international emergency aid are the main sources of foreign exchange. In the
 
    relatively settled year of 1991, industrial production, agricultural output,
 
    and exports showed substantial gains. The further rebuilding of the 
    war-ravaged country was delayed in 1992 because of an upturn in political 
    wrangling. In October 1992, Rafiq HARIRI was appointed Prime Minister. 
    HARIRI, a wealthy entrepreneur, announced ambitious plans for Lebanon's 
    reconstruction which involve a substantial influx of foreign aid and 
    investment. Progress on restoring basic services is limited. Since Prime 
    Minister HARIRI's appointment, the most significant improvement lies in the 
    stabilization of the Lebanese pound, which had gained over 30% in value by 
    yearend 1993. The years 1993 and 1994 were marked by efforts of the new 
    administration to encourage domestic and foreign investment and to obtain 
    additional international assistance. The construction sector led the 8.5% 
    advance in real GDP in 1994.
