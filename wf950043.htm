                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    The Cambodian economy - virtually destroyed by decades of war - is slowly 
    recovering. Government leaders are moving toward restoring fiscal and 
    monetary discipline and have established good working relations with 
    international financial institutions. Growth, starting from a low base, has 
    been strong in 1991-94. Despite such positive developments, the 
    reconstruction effort faces many tough challenges because of the persistence
 
    of internal political divisions and the related lack of confidence of 
    foreign investors. Rural Cambodia, where 90% of about 9.5 million Khmer 
    live, remains mired in poverty. The almost total lack of basic 
    infrastructure in the countryside will hinder development and will 
    contribute to a growing imbalance in growth between urban and rural areas 
    over the near term. Moreover, the government's lack of experience in 
    administering economic and technical assistance programs and rampant 
    corruption among officials will slow the growth of critical public sector 
    investment. Inflation for 1994 as a whole was less than a quarter of the 
    1992 rate and was declining during the year.
