                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Moldova enjoys a favorable climate and good farmland but has no major 
    mineral deposits. As a result, Moldova's economy is primarily based on 


    agriculture, featuring fruits, vegetables, wine, and tobacco. Moldova must 
    import all of its supplies of oil, coal, and natural gas, and energy 
    shortages have contributed to sharp production declines since the breakup of
 
    the Soviet Union in 1991. The Moldovan government is making steady progress 
    on an ambitious economic reform agenda, and the IMF has called Moldova a 
    model for the region. As part of its reform efforts, Chisinau has introduced
 
    a stable currency, freed all prices, stopped issuing preferential credits to
 
    state enterprises and backed their steady privatization, removed export 
    controls, and freed interest rates. Chisinau appears strongly committed to 
    continuing these reforms in 1995. Meanwhile, privatization of medium and 
    large enterprises got underway in mid-1994 and is expected to pick up speed 
    in 1995. To improve its precarious energy situation, Chisinau reached an 
    agreement with Moscow in December 1994 on gas deliveries for 1995. Gazprom, 
    Russia's national gas company, has agreed to reduce prices for natural gas 
    deliveries to Moldova from the world market price of $80/thousand cubic 
    meters (tcm) to $58/tcm in return for part ownership of the Moldovan 
    pipeline system.
