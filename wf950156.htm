                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    A majority of the population still depends on agriculture and livestock for 
    a livelihood, even though most of the nomads and many subsistence farmers 
    were forced into the cities by recurrent droughts in the 1970s and 1980s. 
    Mauritania has extensive deposits of iron ore, which account for almost 50% 
    of total exports. The decline in world demand for this ore, however, has led
 
    to cutbacks in production. The nation's coastal waters are among the richest
 
    fishing areas in the world, but overexploitation by foreigners threatens 
    this key source of revenue. The country's first deepwater port opened near 
    Nouakchott in 1986. In recent years, drought and economic mismanagement have
 
    resulted in a substantial buildup of foreign debt. The government has begun 
    the second stage of an economic reform program in consultation with the 
    World Bank, the IMF, and major donor countries. Short-term growth prospects 
    are gloomy because of the heavy debt service burden, rapid population 


    growth, and vulnerability to climatic conditions.
