                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Spain, with a per capita output approximately two-thirds that of the four 
    leading economies of Western Europe, has shared with these countries the 
    recession of the early 1990s and the upturn of their economic fortunes in 
    1994. But whereas unemployment in these countries has hovered just above 
    10%, Spain has been forced to cope with a 25% unemployment rate. Continued 
    political turmoil has complicated the establishment of stable government 
    policies toward budgetary restraint, interest rates, labor law reform, and 
    Spain's role in the evolving economic integration of Western Europe. Because
 
    the recession has been so deep, the growth in industrial output, tourism, 
    and other sectors in 1994, while welcome, falls far short of the growth 
    required to bring unemployment down to, say, 10%. The recovery in the 
    economies of major trade partners, the comparatively low inflation rate, 
    lower interest rates, and prospects in the tourist sector suggest that Spain
 
    can make substantial progress in 1995.
