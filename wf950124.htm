                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    The economy is based largely on financial services, agriculture, and 
    tourism. Potatoes, cauliflower, tomatoes, and especially flowers are 
    important export crops, shipped mostly to the UK. The Jersey breed of dairy 
    cattle is known worldwide and represents an important export earner. Milk 
    products go to the UK and other EU countries. In 1986 the finance sector 


    overtook tourism as the main contributor to GDP, accounting for 40% of the 
    island's output. In recent years the government has encouraged light 
    industry to locate in Jersey, with the result that an electronics industry 
    has developed alongside the traditional manufacturing of knitwear. All raw 
    material and energy requirements are imported, as well as a large share of 
    Jersey's food needs.
