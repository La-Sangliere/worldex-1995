                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    The economy is based on service activities connected with the country's 
    strategic location and status as a free trade zone in northeast Africa. 
    Two-thirds of the inhabitants live in the capital city, the remainder being 
    mostly nomadic herders. Scanty rainfall limits crop production to fruits and
 
    vegetables, and most food must be imported. Djibouti provides services as 
    both a transit port for the region and an international transshipment and 
    refueling center. It has few natural resources and little industry. The 
    nation is, therefore, heavily dependent on foreign assistance (an important 
    supplement to GDP) to help support its balance of payments and to finance 
    development projects. An unemployment rate of over 30% continues to be a 
    major problem. Per capita consumption dropped an estimated 35% over the last
 
    six years because of recession, civil war, and a high population growth rate
 
    (including immigrants and refugees).
