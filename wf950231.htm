                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    In 1990-93 Syria's state-dominated Ba'thist economy benefited from the Gulf 
    war, increased oil production, good weather, and economic deregulation. 
    Economic growth averaged roughly 10%. The Gulf war provided Syria an aid 
    windfall of nearly $5 billion dollars from Arab, European, and Japanese 
    donors. However, the benefits of the 1990-93 boom were not evenly 
    distributed and the gap between rich and poor is widening. A nationwide 
    financial scandal and increasing inflation were accompanied by a decline in 
    GDP growth to 4% in 1994. For the long run, Syria's economy is still saddled
 
    with a large number of poorly performing public sector firms, and industrial
 
    productivity remains to be improved. Oil production is likely to fall off 
    dramatically by the end of the decade. Unemployment will become a problem 
    for the government when the more than 60% of the population under the age of
 
    20 enter the labor force.
