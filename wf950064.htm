    gave the Turkish Cypriots de facto control in the north; Greek Cypriots 
    control the only internationally recognized government; on 15 November 1983 
    Turkish Cypriot President Rauf DENKTASH declared independence and the

                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    The Greek Cypriot economy is small, diversified, and prosperous. Industry 
    contributes 14% to GDP and employs 29% of the labor force, while the service
 
    sector contributes 53% to GDP and employs 57% of the labor force. An average
 
    6.8% rise in real GDP between 1986 and 1990 was temporarily checked in 1991,
 
    because of the adverse effects of the Gulf war on tourism. After surging 
    8.5% in 1992, growth slowed to 2.0% in 1993 - its lowest level in two 
    decades - because of the decline in tourist arrivals associated with the 
    recession in Western Europe, Cyprus' main trading partner, and the loss in 
    export competitiveness due to a sharp rise in unit labor costs. Real GDP is 
    likely to have picked up in 1994, and inflation is estimated to have risen 
    to between 5% and 6%. The Turkish Cypriot economy has less than one-third 
    the per capita GDP of the south. Because it is recognized only by Turkey, it
 
    has had much difficulty arranging foreign financing, and foreign firms have 
    hesitated to invest there. The economy remains heavily dependent on 
    agriculture, which employs one-quarter of the work force. Moreover, because 
    the Turkish lira is legal tender, the Turkish Cypriot economy has suffered 
    the same high inflation as mainland Turkey. The small, vulnerable economy is
 
    estimated to have experienced a sharp drop in growth during 1994 because of 
    the severe economic crisis affecting the mainland. To compensate for the 
    economy's weakness, Turkey provides direct and indirect aid to nearly every 
    sector; financial support has risen in value to about one-third of Turkish 
    Cypriot GDP.
