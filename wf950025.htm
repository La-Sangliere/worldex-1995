                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Belarus ranks among the most developed of the former Soviet states, with a 
    relatively modern - by Soviet standards - and diverse machine building 
    sector and a robust agriculture sector. It also serves as a transport link 
    for Russian oil exports to the Baltic states and Eastern and Western Europe.
 
    The breakup of the Soviet Union and its command economy has resulted in a 
    sharp economic contraction as traditional trade ties have collapsed. The 
    Belarusian government has lagged behind the governments of most other former
 
    Soviet states in economic reform, with privatization almost nonexistent. The
 
    system of state orders and distribution persists. In mid-1994, the 
    Belarusian government embarked on an austerity program with IMF support to 
    slash state credits and consumer subsidies in order to bring down the budget
 
    deficit and reduce inflation. However, despite its promising start, the 
    regime's drive to reinvigorate the economy has fallen short, and the IMF has
 
    criticized its failure to implement the reforms that the Fund had 
    negotiated. As a result, the IMF has suspended talks on introducing a 
    stand-by arrangement. Economic relations with Russia, which will have an 
    important bearing on the future course of the economy, will be strengthened 
    if Minsk adopts the necessary legislation to implement a customs union 
    agreed to in January 1995.
