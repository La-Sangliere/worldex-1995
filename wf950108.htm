                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Hong Kong has a bustling free market economy with few tariffs or nontariff 
    barriers. Natural resources are limited, and food and raw materials must be 
    imported. Manufacturing accounts for about 17% of GDP. Goods and services 
    exports account for about 50% of GDP. Real GDP growth averaged a remarkable 
    8% in 1987-88, slowed to 3.0% in 1989-90, and picked up to 4.2% in 1991, 
    5.0% in 1992, 5.2% in 1993, and 5.5% in 1994. Unemployment, which has been 
    declining since the mid-1980s, is now about 2%. A shortage of labor 
    continues to put upward pressure on prices and the cost of living. Prospects
 


    for 1995-96 remain bright so long as major trading partners continue to be 
    reasonably prosperous and so long as investors feel China will support free 
    market practices after the takeover in 1997.
