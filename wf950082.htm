                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    One of the world's most highly developed economies, France has substantial 
    agricultural resources and a diversified modern industrial sector. Large 
    tracts of fertile land, the application of modern technology, and subsidies 
    have combined to make it the leading agricultural producer in Western 
    Europe. Largely self-sufficient in agricultural products, France is a major 
    exporter of wheat and dairy products. The industrial sector generates about 
    one-quarter of GDP, and the growing services sector has become crucial to 
    the economy. Following stagnation and recession in 1991-93, French GDP in 
    1994 expanded 2.4%. Growth in 1995 is expected to be in the 3.0% to 3.5% 
    range. Persistently high unemployment will still pose a major problem for 
    the government. Paris remains committed to maintaining the franc-deutsche 
    mark parity, which has kept French interest rates high despite France's low 
    inflation. Although the pace of economic and financial integration within 
    the European Union has slowed down, integration presumably will remain a 
    major force shaping the fortunes of the various economic sectors over the 
    next few years.
