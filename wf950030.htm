                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    The economy, one of the world's least developed, is based on agriculture and
 
    forestry, which provide the main livelihood for 90% of the population and 
    account for about half of GDP. Agriculture consists largely of subsistence 
    farming and animal husbandry. Rugged mountains dominate the terrain and make
 
    the building of roads and other infrastructure difficult and expensive. The 
    economy is closely aligned with India's through strong trade and monetary 
    links. The industrial sector is small and technologically backward, with 
    most production of the cottage industry type. Most development projects, 
    such as road construction, rely on Indian migrant labor. Bhutan's hydropower
 
    potential and its attraction for tourists are key resources; however, the 
    government limits the number of tourists to 4,000 per year to minimize 
    foreign influence. Much of the impetus for growth has come from large 
    public-sector companies. Nevertheless, in recent years, Bhutan has shifted 
    toward decentralized development planning and greater private initiative. 
    The government privatized several large public-sector firms, is revamping 
    its trade regime and liberalizing administerial procedures over industrial 
    licensing. The government's industrial contribution to GDP decreased from 
    13% in 1988 to about 11% in 1993.
