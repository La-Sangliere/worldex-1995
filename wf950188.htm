                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Because of its key geographic location, Panama's economy is service-based, 
    heavily weighted toward banking, commerce, and tourism. Trade and financial 
    ties with the US are especially close. GDP grew at 3.6% in 1994, a 
    respectable rate, yet below the 7.1% average of the early 1990s. Banking and
 
    financial services and trade through the Colon Free Zone continued to expand
 
    rapidly, with the industrial and agricultural sectors experiencing little 
    growth. The new administration, inaugurated 1 September 1994, has launched 
    an economic plan designed to reverse rising unemployment, attract foreign 
    investment, cut back the size of government, and modernize the economy. The 
    success of the plan in meeting its goals for 1995 and beyond depends largely
 
    on the success of the administration in reforming the labor code and 
    instituting the reforms necessary to join the GATT.
