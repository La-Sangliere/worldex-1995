                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Agriculture, forestry, and fishing account for about half of GDP and nearly 
    all exports. Subsistence farming predominates. Although pre-independence 
    Equatorial Guinea counted on cocoa production for hard currency earnings, 
    the deterioration of the rural economy under successive brutal regimes has 
    diminished potential for agriculture-led growth. A number of aid programs 
    sponsored by the World Bank and the international donor community have 
    failed to revitalize export agriculture. Businesses for the most part are 
    owned by government officials and their family members. Commerce accounts 
    for about 8% of GDP and the construction, public works, and service sectors 
    for about 38%. Undeveloped natural resources include titanium, iron ore, 
    manganese, uranium, and alluvial gold. Oil exploration, taking place under 
    concessions offered to US, French, and Spanish firms, has been moderately 
    successful. Increased production from recently discovered natural gas fields
 
    will provide a greater share of exports in 1995.
