                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Switzerland's economy - one of the most prosperous and stable in the world -
 
    is nonetheless undergoing a stressful adjustment after both the inflationary
 
    boom of the late 1980s and the electorate's rejection of membership in the 
    European Economic Area (EEA) in 1992. So far the decision to remain outside 
    the European single market structure does not appear to have harmed Swiss 
    interests. In December 1994, the Swiss began bilateral negotiations with the
 
    EU aimed at establishing closer ties in areas of mutual interest and 
    progressing toward the free circulation of persons, goods, capital, and 
    services between the two parties. The Swiss emerged from a three-year 
    recession in mid-1993 and posted 1.8% GDP growth in 1994. The Swiss central 
    bank's tight monetary policies brought inflation down from about 4% in 1992 
    to just under 1% in 1994. Unemployment has fallen slightly from 5.1% in 1993
 
    to 4.7% in 1994. Swiss per capita output, living standards, education, and 
    health care remain unsurpassed in Europe. The country has few mineral 
    resources, but its spectacular natural beauty sustains a substantial tourism
 
    industry.
