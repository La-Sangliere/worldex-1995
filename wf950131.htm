                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    A remote country of 33 scattered coral atolls, Kiribati has few national 
    resources. Commercially viable phosphate deposits were exhausted at the time
 
    of independence in 1979. Copra and fish now represent the bulk of production
 
    and exports. The economy has fluctuated widely in recent years. Real GDP 
    declined about 5% in 1987, as the fish catch fell sharply to only one-fourth
 
    the level of 1986 and copra production was hampered by repeated rains. 
    Output rebounded strongly in 1988, with real GDP growing by 10%. The upturn 
    in economic growth came from an increase in copra production and a good fish
 
    catch. GDP then fell by 2.2% in 1989 and by 2.9% in 1990, but has risen by 
    about 3% annually in 1991-93. Foreign financial aid, largely from the UK and
 
    Japan, is a critical supplement to GDP, amounting to 25%-50% of GDP in 
    recent years.
