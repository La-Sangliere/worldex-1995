                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    The economy is heavily dependent on subsistence agriculture, which accounts 


    for about half of GDP and provides employment for 80% of the labor force. 
    Primary agricultural exports are cocoa, coffee, and cotton, which together 
    generate about 30% of total export earnings. Togo is self-sufficient in 
    basic foodstuffs when harvests are normal. In the industrial sector 
    phosphate mining is by far the most important activity, although it has 
    suffered from the collapse of world phosphate prices and increased foreign 
    competition. Togo serves as a regional commercial and trade center. The 
    government's decade-long IMF and World Bank supported effort to implement 
    economic reform measures to encourage foreign investment and bring revenues 
    in line with expenditures has stalled. Political unrest, including private 
    and public sector strikes throughout 1992 and 1993, has jeopardized the 
    reform program, shrunk the tax base, and disrupted vital economic activity. 
    Although strikes had ended in 1994, political unrest and lack of funds 
    prevented the government from taking advantage of the 50% currency 
    devaluation of January 1994. Resumption of World Bank and IMF flows will 
    depend on implementation of several controversial moves toward privatization
 
    and on downsizing the military, on which the regime depends to stay in 
    power.
