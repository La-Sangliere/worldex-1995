Overview: 
    Although possessing major mineral and hydropower resources and considerable 
    potential for agricultural development, Guinea remains one of the poorest 
    countries in the world. The agricultural sector contributes about 40% to GDP
 
    and employs 80% of the work force, while industry accounts for 27% of GDP. 
    Guinea possesses over 25% of the world's bauxite reserves. The mining sector
 
    accounted for 85% of exports in 1991. Long-run improvements in literacy, 
    financial institutions, and the legal framework are needed if the country is
 
    to move out of poverty. Except in the bauxite industry, foreign investment 
    remains minimal.
