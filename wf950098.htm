                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    The economy depends mainly on US military spending and on revenues from 
    tourism. Over the past 20 years the tourist industry has grown rapidly, 
    creating a construction boom for new hotels and the expansion of older ones.
 
    Visitors numbered about 900,000 in 1992. The slowdown in Japanese economic 
    growth has been reflected in less vigorous growth in the tourism sector. 
    About 60% of the labor force works for the private sector and the rest for 
    government. Most food and industrial goods are imported, with about 75% from
 
    the US. Guam faces the problem of building up the civilian economic sector 
    to offset the impact of military downsizing.
