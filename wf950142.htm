Overview: 
    Despite its small size and limited natural resources, Liechtenstein has 
    developed into a prosperous, highly industrialized, free-enterprise economy 
    with a vital service sector and living standards on par with its large 
    European neighbors. Low business taxes - the maximum tax rate is 20% - and 
    easy incorporation rules have induced about 25,000 holding or so-called 
    letter box companies to establish nominal offices in Liechtenstein, 
    providing 30% of state revenues. The country participates in a customs union
 
    with Switzerland and uses the Swiss franc as its national currency. 
    Liechtenstein plans to join the European Economic Area (an organization 
    serving as a bridge between EFTA and EU) in 1995.
