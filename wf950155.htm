                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    The economy is based on sugarcane, bananas, tourism, and light industry. 
    Agriculture accounts for about 10% of GDP and the small industrial sector 
    for 10%. Sugar production has declined, with most of the sugarcane now used 
    for the production of rum. Banana exports are increasing, going mostly to 
    France. The bulk of meat, vegetable, and grain requirements must be 
    imported, contributing to a chronic trade deficit that requires large annual
 
    transfers of aid from France. Tourism has become more important than 
    agricultural exports as a source of foreign exchange. The majority of the 
    work force is employed in the service sector and in administration. Banana 
    workers launched protests late in 1992 because of falling banana prices and 


    fears of greater competition in the European market from other producers.
