                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Civil war since 1990 has destroyed much of Liberia's economy, especially the
 
    infrastructure in and around Monrovia. Businessmen have fled the country, 
    taking capital and expertise with them. Many will not return. Richly endowed
 
    with water, mineral resources, forests, and a climate favorable to 
    agriculture, Liberia had been a producer and exporter of basic products, 
    while local manufacturing, mainly foreign owned, had been small in scope. 
    Political instability threatens prospects for economic reconstruction and 
    repatriation of some 750,000 Liberian refugees who have fled to neighboring 
    countries. The political impasse between the interim government and rebel 
    leader Charles TAYLOR has prevented restoration of normal economic life, 
    including the re-establishment of a strong central government with effective
 
    economic development programs. The economy deteriorated further in 1994.
