                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Since independence in September 1991, Lithuania has made steady progress in 
    developing a market economy. Almost 50% of state property has been 
    privatized and trade is diversifying with a gradual shift away from the 
    former Soviet Union to Western markets. In addition, the Lithuanian 
    government has adhered to a disciplined budgetary and financial policy which
 
    has brought inflation down from a monthly average of around 14% in first 
    half 1993 to an average of 3.1% in 1994. Nevertheless, the process has been 
    painful with industrial output in 1993 less than half the 1991 level. The 
    economy appeared to have bottomed out in 1994, and Vilnius's policies have 
    laid the groundwork for vigorous recovery over the next few years. Recovery 
    will build on Lithuanian's strategic location with its ice-free port at 


    Klaipeda and its rail and highway hub in Vilnius connecting it with Eastern 
    Europe, Belarus, Russia, and Ukraine, and on its agriculture potential, 
    highly skilled labor force, and diversified industrial sector. Lacking 
    important natural resources, it will remain dependent on imports of fuels 
    and raw materials.

    freezers 5.4%; other branches: petroleum refining, shipbuilding (small
