                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    One of the world's poorest countries, Comoros is made up of several islands 
    that have poor transportation links, a young and rapidly increasing 
    population, and few natural resources. The low educational level of the 
    labor force contributes to a subsistence level of economic activity, high 
    unemployment, and a heavy dependence on foreign grants and technical 
    assistance. Agriculture, including fishing, hunting, and forestry, is the 
    leading sector of the economy. It contributes 40% to GDP, employs 80% of the
 
    labor force, and provides most of the exports. The country is not 
    self-sufficient in food production; rice, the main staple, accounts for 90% 


    of imports. The government is struggling to upgrade education and technical 
    training, to privatize commercial and industrial enterprises, to improve 
    health services, to diversify exports, and to reduce the high population 
    growth rate. Continued foreign support is essential if the goal of 4% annual
 
    GDP growth is to be reached in the late 1990s.
