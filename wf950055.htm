                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Colombia's economy has grown steadily since 1991, when the government 
    implemented sweeping economic reform measures. President SAMPER, who took 
    office in August 1994, has pledged to maintain those reforms while expanding
 
    government assistance for poor Colombians, who continue to make up about 40%
 
    of the population. In an effort to bring down inflation, SAMPER has arranged
 
    a "social pact" with business and labor to curtail price hikes and trim 
    inflation to 18%. The rapid development of oil, coal, and other 
    nontraditional industries, along with copious inflows of capital and 
    strengthening of prices for coffee, have helped keep growth at 5%-6%. 
    Development of the massive Cusiana oilfield provides the means to sustain 
    this level over the next several years. Exporters say, however, that their 
    sales have been hampered by the appreciation of the Colombian peso, and 
    farmers have sought government help in adjusting to greater foreign 
    competition. Moreover, increased foreign investment and even greater 
    domestic growth have been hindered by an inadequate energy and 
    transportation infrastructure and by violence stemming from drug trafficking
 
    and persistent rural insurgency.
