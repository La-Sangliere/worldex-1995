                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    The government of the Czech Republic, using successful stabilization 


    policies to bolster its claims to full membership in the western economic 
    community, has reduced inflation to 10%, kept unemployment at 3%, balanced 
    the budget, run trade surpluses, and reoriented exports to the EU since the 
    breakup of the Czechoslovak federation on 1 January 1993. GDP grew 2% in 
    1994 after stagnating in 1993 and contracting nearly 20% since 1990. 
    Prague's mass privatization program, including its innovative distribution 
    of ownership shares to Czech citizens via 'coupon vouchers,' has made the 
    most rapid progress in Eastern Europe. When coupon shares are distributed in
 
    early 1995, 75%-80% of the economy will be in private hands or partially 
    privatized, according to the Czech government. Privatized companies still 
    face major problems in restructuring; the number of annual bankruptcies 
    quadrupled in 1994. In September 1994, Prague repaid $471 million in IMF 
    loans five years ahead of schedule, making the Czech Republic the first East
 
    European country to pay off all IMF debts. Despite these outlays, 
    hard-currency reserves in the banking system totaled more than $8.5 billion 
    in October. Standard & Poor's boosted the Republic's credit rating to BBB+ 
    in mid-1994 - up from a BBB rating that was already two steps higher than 
    Hungary's and one step above Greece's rating. Prague forecasts a balanced 
    budget, at least 3% GDP growth, 5% unemployment, and single-digit inflation 
    for 1995. Inflationary pressures - primarily as a result of foreign bank 
    lending to Czech enterprises but perhaps also due to eased currency 
    convertibility controls - are likely to be the most troublesome issues in 
    1995. Continuing economic recovery in Western Europe should boost Czech 
    exports and production but a substantial increase in prices could erode the 
    Republic's comparative advantage in low wages and exchange rates. Prague 
    already took steps in 1994 to increase control over banking policies to 
    neutralize the impact of foreign inflows on the money supply. Although Czech
 
    unemployment is currently the lowest in Central Europe, it will probably 
    increase 1-2 percentage points in 1995 as large state firms go bankrupt or 
    are restructured and service sector growth slows.
