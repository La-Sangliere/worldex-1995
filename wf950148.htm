                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Landlocked Malawi ranks among the world's least developed countries. The 
    economy is predominately agricultural, with about 90% of the population 
    living in rural areas. Agriculture accounts for 40% of GDP and 90% of export
 
    revenues. After two years of weak performance, economic growth improved 
    significantly in 1988-91 as a result of good weather and a broadly based 
    economic adjustment effort by the government. Drought cut overall output 
    sharply in 1992, but the lost ground was recovered in 1993. The economy 
    depends on substantial inflows of economic assistance from the IMF, the 
    World Bank, and individual donor nations. The new government faces strong 
    challenges, e.g., to spur exports, to improve educational and health 
    facilities, and to deal with environmental problems of deforestation and 
    erosion.
