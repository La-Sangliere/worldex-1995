                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    More than 90% of this command economy is socialized; agricultural land is 
    collectivized; and state-owned industry produces 95% of manufactured goods. 
    State control of economic affairs is unusually tight even for a Communist 
    country because of the small size and homogeneity of the society and the 
    strict rule of KIM Il-song in the past and now his son, KIM Chong-il. 
    Economic growth during the period 1984-88 averaged 2%-3%, but output 
    declined by 3%-5% annually during 1989-92 because of systemic problems and 
    disruptions in socialist-style economic relations with the former USSR and 
    China. In 1992, output dropped sharply, by perhaps 7%-9%, as the economy 
    felt the cumulative effect of the reduction in outside support. The 
    leadership insisted on maintaining its high level of military outlays from a
 
    shrinking economic pie. Moreover, a serious drawdown in inventories and 
    critical shortages in the energy sector have led to increasing interruptions
 
    in industrial production. Abundant mineral resources and hydropower have 
    formed the basis of industrial development since World War II. Output of the
 
    extractive industries includes coal, iron ore, magnesite, graphite, copper, 
    zinc, lead, and precious metals. Manufacturing is centered on heavy 
    industry, including military industry, with light industry lagging far 
    behind. Despite the use of improved seed varieties, expansion of irrigation,
 
    and the heavy use of fertilizers, North Korea has not yet become 
    self-sufficient in food production. Indeed, a shortage of arable lands, 
    several years of poor harvests, and a cumbersome distribution system have 
    resulted in chronic food shortages. The collapse of Communism in the former 
    Soviet Union and Eastern Europe in 1989-91 has disrupted important 
    technological links. North Korea remains far behind South Korea in economic 
    development and living standards. GDP is stagnant.
