                                     Economy 


 
Overview: 
    Tanzania is one of the poorest countries in the world. The economy is 
    heavily dependent on agriculture, which accounts for about 58% of GDP, 
    provides 85% of exports, and employs 90% of the work force. Topography and 
    climatic conditions, however, limit cultivated crops to only 5% of the land 
    area. Industry accounts for 8% of GDP and is mainly limited to processing 
    agricultural products and light consumer goods. The economic recovery 
    program announced in mid-1986 has generated notable increases in 
    agricultural production and financial support for the program by bilateral 
    donors. The World Bank, the International Monetary Fund, and bilateral 
    donors have provided funds to rehabilitate Tanzania's deteriorated economic 
    infrastructure. Growth in 1991-94 has featured a pickup in industrial 
    production and a substantial increase in output of minerals, led by gold. 
    Recent banking reforms have helped increase private sector growth and 
    investment.
