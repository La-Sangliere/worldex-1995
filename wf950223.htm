Overview: 
    Economic activity is limited to commercial fishing. The proximity to nearby 
    oil- and gas-producing sedimentary basins suggests the potential for oil and
 
    gas deposits, but the region is largely unexplored, and there are no 
    reliable estimates of potential reserves; commercial exploitation has yet to
 
    be developed.
