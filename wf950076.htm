                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    With the independence of Eritrea on 27 April 1993, Ethiopia continues to 
    face difficult economic problems as one of the poorest and least developed 
    countries in Africa. Its economy is based on agriculture, which accounts for
 
    about 45% of GDP, 90% of exports, and 80% of total employment; coffee 
    generates 60% of export earnings. The agricultural sector suffers from 
    frequent periods of drought, poor cultivation practices, and deterioration 
    of internal security conditions. The manufacturing sector is heavily 
    dependent on inputs from the agricultural sector. Over 90% of large-scale 
    industry, but less than 10% of agriculture, is state run. The government is 
    considering selling off a portion of state-owned plants, and is implementing
 
    reform measures that are gradually liberalizing the economy. A major 
    medium-term problem is the improvement of roads, water supply, and other 
    parts of an infrastructure badly neglected during years of civil strife.
