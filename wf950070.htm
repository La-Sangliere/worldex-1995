                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Ecuador has substantial oil resources and rich agricultural areas. Growth 
    has been uneven in recent years because of fluctuations in prices for 
    Ecuador's primary exports - oil and bananas - as well as because of 
    government policies designed to curb inflation. President Sixto DURAN-BALLEN
 
    launched a series of macroeconomic reforms when he came into office in 
    August 1992 which included raising domestic fuel prices and utility rates, 
    eliminating most subsidies, and bringing the government budget into balance.
 
    These measures helped to reduce inflation from 55% in 1992 to 25% in 1994. 
    DURAN-BALLEN has a much more favorable attitude toward foreign investment 
    than his predecessor and has supported several laws designed to encourage 
    foreign investment. Ecuador has implemented free or complementary trade 


    agreements with Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Peru, and Venezuela, as well as 
    applied for World Trade Organization membership. Ecuador signed a standby 
    agreement with the IMF and rescheduled its $7.6 billion commercial debt in 
    1994 thereby regaining access to multilateral lending. Growth in 1994 
    speeded up to 3.9%, based on increased exports of bananas and 
    non-traditional products, while international reserves increased to a record
 
    $1.6 billion.
