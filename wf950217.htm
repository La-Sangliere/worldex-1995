                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Slovenia appears to be making a solid economic recovery, fulfilling the 
    promise it showed at the time of Yugoslavia's breakup. It was by far the 
    most prosperous of the former Yugoslav republics, with a per capita income 
    more than twice the national average. It also benefited from strong ties to 
    Western Europe and suffered comparatively small physical damage in the 
    dismemberment process. The beginning was difficult, however. Real GDP fell 
    15% during 1991-92, while inflation jumped to 247% in 1991 and unemployment 
    topped 8% - nearly three times the 1989 level. The turning point came in 
    1993 when real GDP grew 1%, unemployment leveled off at about 9%, and 
    inflation slowed dramatically to 23%. In 1994, the rate of growth of GDP 
    rose to 4%, unemployment remained stable, and inflation dropped to 20%. This
 
    was accomplished, moreover, without balance-of-payments problems. The 
    government gets generally good economic marks from foreign observers, 
    particularly with regard to fiscal policy - the budget deficit in 1994 was 
    only about 1% of GDP, following several years of small surpluses. Prospects 
    for 1995 appear good, with economic growth expected to remain strong while 
    unemployment and inflation may decline slightly. Privatization, sluggish to 
    date, is expected to pick up in 1995.
