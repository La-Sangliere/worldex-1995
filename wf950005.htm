                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Tourism, the mainstay of Andorra's economy, accounts for roughly 80% of GDP.
 
    An estimated 13 million tourists visit annually, attracted by Andorra's 
    duty-free status and by its summer and winter resorts. The banking sector, 
    with its "tax haven" status, also contributes substantially to the economy. 
    Agricultural production is limited by a scarcity of arable land, and most 
    food has to be imported. The principal livestock activity is sheep raising. 
    Manufacturing consists mainly of cigarettes, cigars, and furniture. Andorra 
    is a member of the EU Customs Union; it is unclear what effect the European 
    Single Market will have on the advantages Andorra obtains from its duty-free
 
    status.
