                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Despite the continuing difficulties in moving away from the former command 
    system, the Romanian economy seems to have bottomed out in 1993-94. Market 
    oriented reforms have been introduced fitfully since the downfall of 
    CEAUSESCU in December 1989, with the result a growing private sector, 
    especially in services. The slow pace of structural reform, however, has 
    exacerbated Romania's high inflation rate and eroded real wages. 


    Agricultural production rebounded in 1993 from the drought-reduced harvest 
    of 1992. The economy continued its recovery in 1994, further gains being 
    realized in agriculture, construction, services, and trade. Food supplies 
    are adequate but expensive. Romania's infrastructure had deteriorated over 
    the last five years due to reduced levels of public investment. Residents of
 
    the capital reported frequent disruptions of heating and water services. The
 
    slow and painful process of conversion to a more open economy will continue 
    in 1995.
