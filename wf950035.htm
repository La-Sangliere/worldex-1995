                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    The economy, with large agrarian, mining, and manufacturing sectors, entered
 
    the 1990s with declining real growth, runaway inflation, an unserviceable 
    foreign debt of $122 billion, and a lack of policy direction. In addition, 
    the economy remained highly regulated, inward-looking, and protected by 
    substantial trade and investment barriers. Ownership of major industrial and
 
    mining facilities is divided among private interests - including several 
    multinationals - and the government. Most large agricultural holdings are 
    private, with the government channeling financing to this sector. Conflicts 
    between large landholders and landless peasants have produced intermittent 
    violence. The COLLOR government, which assumed office in March 1990, 
    launched an ambitious reform program that sought to modernize and 
    reinvigorate the economy by stabilizing prices, deregulating the economy, 
    and opening it to increased foreign competition. Itamar FRANCO, who assumed 
    the presidency following President COLLOR's resignation in December 1992, 
    was out of step with COLLOR's reform agenda; initiatives to redress fiscal 
    problems, privatize state enterprises, and liberalize trade and investment 
    policies lost momentum. Galloping inflation - by June 1994 the monthly rate 
    had risen to nearly 50% - had undermined economic stability. In response, 
    the then finance minister, Fernando Henrique CARDOSO, launched the third 
    phase of his stabilization plan, known as Plano Real, that called for a new 
    currency, the real, which was introduced on 1 July 1994. Inflation 
    subsequently dropped to under 3% per month through the end of 1994. The 
    newly elected President CARDOSO has called for the implementation of 
    sweeping market-oriented reform, including public sector and fiscal reform, 
    privatization, deregulation, and elimination of barriers to increased 
    foreign investment. Brazil's natural resources remain a major, long-term 
    economic strength.
