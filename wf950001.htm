Executive branch: 
  chief of state: 


    President Burhanuddin RABBANI (Interim President July-December 1992; 
    President since 2 January 1993); Vice President Mohammad NABI MOHAMMADI 
    (since NA); election last held 31 December 1992 (next to be held NA); 
    results - Burhanuddin RABBANI was elected to a two-year term by a national 
    shura, later amended by multi-party agreement to 18 months; note - in June 
    1994 failure to agree on a transfer mechanism resulted in RABBANI's 
    extending the term to 28 December 1994; following the expiration of the term
 
    and while negotiations on the formation of a new government go on, RABBANI 
    continues in office 
  head of government: 
    Prime Minister Gulbuddin HIKMATYAR (since 17 March 1993); note - Prime 
    Minister HIKMATYAR is the nominal head of government and does not have any 
    real authority; First Deputy Prime Minister Qutbuddin HELAL (since 17 March 
    1993); Deputy Prime Minister Arsala RAHMANI (since 17 March 1993) 
  cabinet:

                                   Government 
  note: 
    term of present government expired 28 December 1994; factional fighting 
    since 1 January 1994 has kept government officers from actually occupying 
    ministries and discharging government responsibilities; the government's 
    authority to remove cabinet members, including the Prime Minister, following
 
    the expiration of their term is questionable 
Legislative branch: 
    a unicameral parliament consisting of 205 members was chosen by the shura in
 
    January 1993; non-functioning as of June 1993 
Judicial branch:

    court system has not yet been organized

                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Afghanistan is an extremely poor, landlocked country, highly dependent on 
    farming (wheat especially) and livestock raising (sheep and goats). Economic
 
    considerations have played second fiddle to political and military upheavals
 
    during more than 15 years of war, including the nearly 10-year Soviet 
    military occupation (which ended 15 February 1989). Over the past decade, 
    one-third of the population fled the country, with Pakistan sheltering more 
    than 3 million refugees and Iran about 3 million. About 1.4 million Afghan 
    refugees remain in Pakistan and about 2 million in Iran. Another 1 million 
    probably moved into and around urban areas within Afghanistan. Although 
    reliable data are unavailable, gross domestic product is lower than 13 years
 
    ago because of the loss of labor and capital and the disruption of trade and
 
    transport.
