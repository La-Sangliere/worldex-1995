                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Jordan benefited from increased Arab aid during the oil boom of the late 
    1970s and early 1980s, when its annual real GNP growth averaged more than 
    10%. In the remainder of the 1980s, however, reductions in both Arab aid and
 
    worker remittances slowed real economic growth to an average of roughly 2% 
    per year. Imports - mainly oil, capital goods, consumer durables, and food -
 
    outstripped exports, with the difference covered by aid, remittances, and 
    borrowing. In mid-1989, the Jordanian Government began debt-rescheduling 
    negotiations and agreed to implement an IMF-supported program designed to 
    gradually reduce the budget deficit and implement badly needed structural 
    reforms. The Persian Gulf crisis that began in August 1990, however, 
    aggravated Jordan's already serious economic problems, forcing the 
    government to shelve the IMF program, stop most debt payments, and suspend 
    rescheduling negotiations. Aid from Gulf Arab states, worker remittances, 
    and trade contracted; and refugees flooded the country, producing serious 
    balance-of-payments problems, stunting GDP growth, and straining government 
    resources. The economy rebounded in 1992, largely due to the influx of 
    capital repatriated by workers returning from the Gulf, but the recovery was


 
    uneven throughout 1994. The government is implementing the reform program 
    adopted in 1992 and continues to secure rescheduling and write-offs of its 
    heavy foreign debt. Debt, poverty, and unemployment remain Jordan's biggest 
    on-going problems.
