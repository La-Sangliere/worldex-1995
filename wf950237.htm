                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    The economy's base is agriculture, which employs about 70% of the labor 
    force and contributes 40% to GDP. Squash, coconuts, bananas, and vanilla 
    beans are the main crops, and agricultural exports make up two-thirds of 
    total exports. The country must import a high proportion of its food, mainly
 
    from New Zealand. The manufacturing sector accounts for only 11% of GDP. 
    Tourism is the primary source of hard currency earnings, but the country 
    also remains dependent on sizable external aid and remittances to offset its
 
    trade deficit. The economy continued to grow in 1993-94 largely because of a
 
    rise in squash exports, increased aid flows, and several large construction 
    projects. The government is now turning its attention to further development
 
    of the private sector and the reduction of the budget deficit.
