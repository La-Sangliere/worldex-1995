                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Guyana, one of the poorest countries in the Western Hemisphere, has pushed 
    ahead strongly in 1992-94, with an 8% average annual economic growth rate, 
    led by gold mining, and rice, sugar, and forestry products for export. 
    Favorable factors include recovery in the key agricultural and mining 
    sectors, a more favorable atmosphere for business initiative, a more 
    realistic exchange rate, a sharp drop in the inflation rate, and the 
    continued support of international organizations. Serious underlying 
    economic problems will continue. Electric power has been in short supply and
 
    constitutes a major barrier to future gains in national output. The 
    government will have to persist in efforts to manage its large $2.2 billion 
    external debt, control inflation, and to extend the privatization program.
