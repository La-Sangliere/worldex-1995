                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Chile has a prosperous, essentially free market economy, with the degree of 
    government intervention varying according to the philosophy of the different
 
    regimes. Under the center-left government of President AYLWIN, which took 
    power in March 1990, spending on social welfare rose steadily. At the same 
    time business investment, exports, and consumer spending also grew 
    substantially. The new president, FREI, who took office in March 1994, has 
    emphasized social spending even more. Growth in 1991-94 has averaged 6.5% 
    annually, with an estimated one million Chileans having moved out of poverty
 
    in the last four years. Copper remains vital to the health of the economy; 
    Chile is the world's largest producer and exporter of copper. Success in 


    meeting the government's goal of sustained annual growth of 5% depends on 
    world copper prices, the level of confidence of foreign investors and 
    creditors, and the government's own ability to maintain a conservative 
    fiscal stance.
