                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Turkmenistan is largely desert country with nomadic cattle raising, 
    intensive agriculture in irrigated oases, and huge gas and oil resources. 
    Half its irrigated land is planted in cotton making it the world's tenth 
    largest producer. It also has the world's fifth largest reserves of natural 
    gas and significant oil resources. Until the end of 1993, Turkmenistan had 
    experienced less economic disruption than other former Soviet states because
 
    its economy received a boost from higher prices for oil and gas and a sharp 
    increase in hard currency earnings. In 1994, Russia's refusal to export 
    Turkmen gas to hard currency markets and mounting debts of its major 
    customers in the former USSR for gas deliveries contributed to a sharp fall 
    in industrial production and caused the budget to shift from a surplus to a 
    slight deficit. Furthermore, with an authoritarian ex-Communist regime in 
    power and a tribally-based social structure, Turkmenistan has taken a 
    cautious approach to economic reform, hoping to use gas and cotton sales to 
    sustain its inefficient economy. With the onset of economic hard times, even
 
    cautious moves toward economic restructuring and privatization have slowed 
    down. For 1995, Turkmenistan will face continuing constraints on its 
    earnings because of its customers' inability to pay for their gas and a low 
    average cotton crop in 1994. Turkmenistan is working hard to open new gas 
    export channels through Iran and Turkey, but these may take many years to 
    realize.
