                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Norway has a mixed economy involving a combination of free market activity 
    and government intervention. The government controls key areas, such as the 
    vital petroleum sector (through large-scale state enterprises) and 
    extensively subsidizes agriculture, fishing, and areas with sparse 
    resources. Norway also maintains an extensive welfare system that helps 
    propel public sector expenditures to slightly more than 50% of the GDP and 
    results in one of the highest average tax burdens in the world (54%). A 
    small country with a high dependence on international trade, Norway is 
    basically an exporter of raw materials and semiprocessed goods, with an 
    abundance of small- and medium-sized firms, and is ranked among the major 
    shipping nations. The country is richly endowed with natural resources - 
    petroleum, hydropower, fish, forests, and minerals - and is highly dependent
 
    on its oil sector to keep its economy afloat. Norway imports more than half 
    its food needs. Although one of the government's main priorities is to 
    reduce this dependency, this situation is not likely to improve for years to
 
    come. The government also hopes to reduce unemployment and strengthen and 
    diversify the economy through tax reform and a series of expansionary 
    budgets. The budget deficit is expected to hit a record 8% of GDP because of
 
    welfare spending and bail-outs of the banking system. Unemployment is 


    currently running at 8.4% - including those in job programs - because of the
 
    weakness of the economy outside the oil sector. Economic growth, only 1.6% 
    in 1993, moved up to 5.5% in 1994. Oslo opted to stay out of the EU during a
 
    referendum in November 1994.
