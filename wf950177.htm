                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Niger is one of the world's poorest countries, with GDP growth lagging 
    behind the rapid growth of population. The economy is centered on 
    subsistence agriculture, animal husbandry, and reexport trade, and 
    increasingly less on uranium, its major export throughout the 1970s and 
    1980s. Uranium revenues dropped by almost 50% between 1983 and 1990 with the
 
    end of the uranium boom. Terms of trade with Nigeria, Niger's largest 
    regional trade partner, have improved dramatically since the 50% devaluation
 
    of the African franc in January 1994; this devaluation boosted exports of 
    livestock, peas, onions, and the products of Niger's small cotton industry. 
    The government relies on bilateral and multilateral aid for operating 
    expenses and public investment and is strongly induced to adhere to 
    structural adjustment programs designed by the IMF and the World Bank.
