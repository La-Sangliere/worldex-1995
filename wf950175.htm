Overview: 
    Since 1984 the government has been reorienting an agrarian economy dependent
 
    on a guaranteed British market to a more industrialized, open free market 
    economy that can compete on the global scene. The government has hoped that 
    dynamic growth would boost real incomes, broaden and deepen the 
    technological capabilities of the industrial sector, reduce inflationary 
    pressures, and permit the expansion of welfare benefits. The initial results
 
    were mixed: inflation is down from double-digit levels, but growth was 
    sluggish in 1988-91. In 1992-93, growth picked up to 3% annually, a sign 
    that the new economic approach was beginning to pay off. Business confidence
 
    strengthened in 1994, and export demand picked up in the Asia-Pacific 
    region, resulting in 6.2% growth. Inflation remains among the lowest in the 
    industrial world.
