                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Subsistence agriculture, together with forestry, remains the backbone of the
 
    CAR economy, with more than 70% of the population living in outlying areas. 
    The agricultural sector generates about half of GDP. Timber has accounted 
    for about 26% of export earnings and the diamond industry for 54%. Important
 
    constraints to economic development include the CAR's landlocked position, a
 
    poor transportation system, a largely unskilled work force, and a legacy of 
    misdirected macroeconomic policies. A major plus is the large forest 
    reserves, which the government is moving to protect from overexploitation. 
    The 50% devaluation of the currencies of 14 Francophone African nations on 
    12 January 1994 had mixed effects on CAR's economy. While diamond, timber, 
    coffee, and cotton exports increased - leading GDP to increase by 5.5% - 
    inflation rose to 40%, fueled by the rising prices of imports on which the 
    economy depends. CAR's poor resource base and primitive infrastructure will 
    keep it dependent on multilateral donors and France for the foreseeable 
    future.
