                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Because of its offshore oil resources and favorable agricultural conditions,
 
    Cameroon has one of the best-endowed, most diversified primary commodity 


    economies in sub-Saharan Africa. Still, it faces many of the serious 
    problems facing other underdeveloped countries, such as political 
    instability, a top-heavy civil service, and a generally unfavorable climate 
    for business enterprise. The development of the oil sector led rapid 
    economic growth between 1970 and 1985. Growth came to an abrupt halt in 
    1986, precipitated by steep declines in the prices of major exports: coffee,
 
    cocoa, and petroleum. Export earnings were cut by almost one-third, and 
    inefficiencies in fiscal management were exposed. In 1990-93, with support 
    from the IMF and World Bank, the government began to introduce reforms 
    designed to spur business investment, increase efficiency in agriculture, 
    and recapitalize the nation's banks. Political instability, following 
    suspect elections in 1992, brought IMF/WB structural adjustment to a halt. 
    Although the 50% devaluation of the currency in January 1994 improved the 
    potential for export growth, mismanagement remains and is the main barrier 
    to economic improvement.
