                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    One of Africa's poorest countries, Mozambique has failed to exploit the 
    economic potential of its sizable agricultural, hydropower, and 
    transportation resources. Indeed, national output, consumption, and 
    investment declined throughout the first half of the 1980s because of 
    internal disorders, lack of government administrative control, and a growing
 
    foreign debt. A sharp increase in foreign aid, attracted by an economic 
    reform policy, resulted in successive years of economic growth in the late 
    1980s, but aid has declined steadily since 1989. Agricultural output is at 
    only 75% of its 1981 level, and grain has to be imported. Industry operates 
    at only 20%-40% of capacity. The economy depends heavily on foreign 
    assistance to keep afloat. Peace accords signed in October 1992 improved 
    chances of foreign investment, aided IMF-supported economic reforms, and 
    supported continued economic recovery. Elections held in 1994 diverted 
    government attention from the economy, resulting in slippage and delays in 
    the economic reform program. Nonetheless, growth in 1994 was solid and can 
    continue into the late 1990s given continued foreign help in meeting debt 
    obligations.
