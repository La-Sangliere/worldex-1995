Overview: 
    The Faroese, who have long enjoyed the affluent living standards of the 
    Danes and other Scandinavians, now must cope with the decline of the 
    all-important fishing industry and one of the world's heaviest per capita 
    external debts of about $25,000. When the nations of the world extended 
    their fishing zones to 200 nautical miles in the early 1970s, the Faroese no
 
    longer could continue their traditional long-distance fishing and 
    subsequently depleted their own nearby fishing areas. The government's tight
 
    controls on fish stocks and its austerity measures have caused a recession, 
    and subsidy cuts will force nationalization in the fishing industry, which 
    has already been plagued with bankruptcies. Copenhagen has threatened to 
    withhold its annual subsidy of $130 million - roughly one-third of the 
    islands' budget revenues - unless the Faroese make significant efforts to 
    balance their budget. To this extent the Faroe government is expected to 
    continue its tough policies, including introducing a 20% value-added tax 
    (VAT) in 1993, and has agreed to an IMF economic-political stabilization 
    plan. In addition to its annual subsidy, the Danish government has bailed 
    out the second largest Faroe bank to the tune of $140 million since October 
    1992.
