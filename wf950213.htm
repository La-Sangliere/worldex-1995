                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Since independence in 1976, per capita output has grown to roughly seven 
    times the old near-subsistence level, led by the tourist sector, which 
    employs about 30% of the labor force and provides more than 70% of hard 
    currency earnings. In recent years the government has encouraged foreign 
    investment in order to upgrade hotels and other services. At the same time, 
    the government has moved to reduce the high dependence on tourism by 
    promoting the development of farming, fishing, and small-scale 
    manufacturing. The vulnerability of the tourist sector was illustrated by 


    the sharp drop in 1991-92 due largely to the Gulf war. Although the industry
 
    has rebounded, the government recognizes the continuing need for upgrading 
    the sector in the face of stiff international competition.
