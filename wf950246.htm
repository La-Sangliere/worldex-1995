                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    After Russia, the Ukrainian republic was far and away the most important 
    economic component of the former Soviet Union, producing more than three 


    times the output of the next-ranking republic. Its fertile black soil 
    generated more than one-fourth of Soviet agricultural output, and its farms 
    provided substantial quantities of meat, milk, grain, and vegetables to 
    other republics. Likewise, its diversified heavy industry supplied equipment
 
    and raw materials to industrial and mining sites in other regions of the 
    former USSR. In early 1992, the Ukrainian government liberalized most prices
 
    and erected a legal framework for privatization, but widespread resistance 
    to reform within the government and the legislature soon stalled reform 
    efforts and led to some backtracking. Loose monetary and fiscal policies 
    pushed inflation to hyperinflationary levels in late 1993. Greater monetary 
    and fiscal restraint lowered inflation in 1994, but also contributed to an 
    accelerated decline in industrial output. Since his election in July 1994, 
    President KUCHMA has developed - and parliament has approved - a 
    comprehensive economic reform program, maintained financial discipline, and 
    reduced state controls over prices, the exchange rate, and foreign trade. 
    Implementation of KUCHMA's economic agenda will encounter considerable 
    resistance from parliament, entrenched bureaucrats, and industrial interests
 
    and will contribute to further declines in output and rising unemployment 
    which will sorely test the government's ability to stay the course on reform
 
    in 1995.
