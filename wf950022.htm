                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Despite sustained domestic and international efforts to improve economic and
 
    demographic prospects, Bangladesh remains one of the world's poorest, most 
    densely populated, and least developed nations. Its economy is 
    overwhelmingly agricultural, with the cultivation of rice the single most 
    important activity in the economy. Major impediments to growth include 
    frequent cyclones and floods, the inefficiency of state-owned enterprises, a
 
    rapidly growing labor force that cannot be absorbed by agriculture, delays 
    in exploiting energy resources (natural gas), and inadequate power supplies.
 
    Excellent rice crops and expansion of the export garment industry led to 
    real growth of 4% in 1992 and again in 1993. Policy measures intended to 
    reduce government regulation of private industry, to curb population growth,
 
    and to expand employment opportunities have had only partial success given 
    the serious nature of Bangladesh's basic problems.
