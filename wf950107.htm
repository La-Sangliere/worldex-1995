                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Honduras is one of the poorest countries in the Western Hemisphere. 
    Agriculture, the most important sector of the economy, accounts for 28% of 
    GDP, employs 62% of the labor force, and produces two-thirds of exports. 
    Productivity remains low. Manufacturing, still in its early stages, employs 
    9% of the labor force, accounts for 15% of GDP, and generates 20% of 
    exports. The service sectors, including public administration, account for 
    50% of GDP and employ 20% of the labor force. Many basic problems face the 
    economy, including rapid population growth, high unemployment, inflation, a 
    lack of basic services, a large and inefficient public sector, and the 
    dependence of the export sector mostly on coffee and bananas, which are 
    subject to sharp price fluctuations. A far-reaching reform program, 
    initiated by former President CALLEJAS in 1990 and scaled back by President 
    REINA, is beginning to take hold.
