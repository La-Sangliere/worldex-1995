                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    This thoroughly modern economy features high-tech agriculture, up-to-date 
    small-scale and corporate industry, extensive government welfare measures, 
    comfortable living standards, and high dependence on foreign trade. Denmark 
    is self-sufficient in food production. The new center-left coalition 
    government will concentrate on reducing the persistent high unemployment 
    rate and the budget deficit as well as following the previous government's 
    policies of maintaining low inflation and a current account surplus. In the 
    face of recent international market pressure on the Danish krone, the 
    coalition has also vowed to maintain a stable currency. The coalition hopes 
    to lower marginal income taxes while maintaining overall tax revenues; boost
 
    industrial competitiveness through labor market and tax reforms and 
    increased research and development funds; and improve welfare services for 
    the neediest while cutting paperwork and delays. Prime Minister RASMUSSEN's 
    reforms will focus on adapting Denmark to the criteria for European 
    integration by 1999; although Copenhagen has won from the European Union 
    (EU) the right to opt out of the European Monetary Union (EMU) if a national
 
    referendum rejects it. Denmark is, in fact, one of the few EU countries 
    likely to fit into the EMU on time. Denmark is weathering the current 
    worldwide slump better than many West European countries. After posting 4.5%
 
    real GDP growth in 1994, Copenhagen is predicting a continued strong showing
 
    in 1995, with real GDP up by 3.2%. The government expects an upswing in 
    business investment in 1995 to drive economic growth. Although unemployment 
    is high, it remains stable compared to most European countries.
