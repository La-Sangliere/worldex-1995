                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    The driving force behind the economy's dynamic growth has been the planned 
    development of an export-oriented economy in a vigorously entrepreneurial 
    society. Real GDP increased more than 10% annually between 1986 and 1991. 
    This growth ultimately led to an overheated situation characterized by a 
    tight labor market, strong inflationary pressures, and a rapidly rising 
    current account deficit. As a result, in 1992, economic policy focused on 
    slowing the growth rate of inflation and reducing the deficit. Annual growth
 
    slowed to 5%, still above the rate in most other countries of the world, and
 
    recovered to 6.3% in 1993. The economy expanded by 8.3% in 1994, driven by 
    booming exports.
