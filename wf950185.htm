                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    The Pakistani economy has made progress in several key areas since Benazir 
    BHUTTO became Prime Minister in October 1993. She has been under pressure 
    from international donors and the IMF - which gave Pakistan a $1.3 billion 
    structural adjustment credit in February 1994 - to continue the economic 
    reforms and austerity measures begun by her predecessor, caretaker Prime 
    Minister Moeen QURESHI (July-October 1993). Foreign exchange reserves 
    climbed to more than $3 billion in 1994, and the budget deficit was 
    substantially reduced. Real GDP growth was 4% in FY93/94, up from 2.3% in 
    FY92/93. Foreign direct and portfolio investment also have increased. 
    Privatization of large public sector utilities began in 1994 with the sale 
    of 12% of the Pakistan Telecommunications Corporation (PTC) and the Water 
    and Power Development Authority (WAPDA); the sale of state-owned banks and 
    other large units are planned for 1995. Still, the government must cope with
 
    long-standing economic vulnerabilities - high levels of debt service and 
    defense spending, a small tax base, a huge population, and dependence on 
    cotton-based exports - which hamper its ability to create a stable economic 
    environment. In addition, Pakistan's infrastructure is inadequate and 
    deteriorating, low levels of literacy constrain industrial growth, and 
    increasing sectarian, ethnic, and tribal violence disrupt production.
