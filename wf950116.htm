Title         :Iraq 
Text          : 
                                      Iraq 
 
                                    Geography 
 
Location: 
    Middle East, bordering the Persian Gulf, between Iran and Kuwait 
Map references: 
    Middle East 
Area: 
  total area: 
    437,072 sq km 
  land area: 
    432,162 sq km 
  comparative area: 
    slightly more than twice the size of Idaho 
Land boundaries: 
    total 3,631 km, Iran 1,458 km, Jordan 181 km, Kuwait 242 km, Saudi Arabia 
    814 km, Syria 605 km, Turkey 331 km 
Coastline: 
    58 km 
Maritime claims: 
  continental shelf: 
    not specified 
  territorial sea: 
    12 nm 
International disputes: 
    Iran and Iraq restored diplomatic relations in 1990 but are still trying to 
    work out written agreements settling outstanding disputes from their 


    eight-year war concerning border demarcation, prisoners-of-war, and freedom 
    of navigation and sovereignty over the Shatt al Arab waterway; in November 
    1994, Iraq formally accepted the UN-demarcated border with Kuwait which had 
    been spelled out in Security Council Resolutions 687 (1991), 773 (1993), and
 
    883 (1993); this formally ends earlier claims to Kuwait and to Bubiyan and 
    Warbah islands; potential dispute over water development plans by Turkey for
 
    the Tigris and Euphrates Rivers 
Climate: 
    mostly desert; mild to cool winters with dry, hot, cloudless summers; 
    northern mountainous regions along Iranian and Turkish borders experience 
    cold winters with occasionally heavy snows which melt in early spring, 
    sometimes causing extensive flooding in central and southern Iraq 
Terrain: 
    mostly broad plains; reedy marshes along Iranian border in south; mountains 
    along borders with Iran and Turkey 
Natural resources: 
    petroleum, natural gas, phosphates, sulfur 
Land use: 
  arable land: 
    12% 
  permanent crops: 
    1% 
  meadows and pastures: 
    9% 
  forest and woodland: 
    3% 
  other: 
    75% 
Irrigated land: 
    25,500 sq km (1989 est) 
 
                                    Geography 
Environment: 
  current issues: 
    government water control projects have drained most of the inhabited marsh 
    areas west of Al Qurnah by drying up or diverting the feeder streams and 
    rivers; a once sizable population of Shi'a Muslims, who have inhabited these
 
    areas for thousands of years, has been displaced; furthermore, the 
    destruction of the natural habitat poses serious threats to the area's 
    wildlife populations; inadequate supplies of potable water; development of 
    Tigris-Euphrates Rivers system contingent upon agreements with upstream 
    riparian Turkey; air and water pollution; soil degradation (salinization) 
    and erosion; desertification 
  natural hazards: 
    duststorms, sandstorms, floods 
  international agreements: 
    party to - Law of the Sea, Nuclear Test Ban; signed, but not ratified - 
    Environmental Modification

                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    The Ba'thist regime engages in extensive central planning and management of 
    industrial production and foreign trade while leaving some small-scale 
    industry and services and most agriculture to private enterprise. The 
    economy has been dominated by the oil sector, which has traditionally 
    provided about 95% of foreign exchange earnings. In the 1980s, financial 
    problems caused by massive expenditures in the eight-year war with Iran and 
    damage to oil export facilities by Iran, led the government to implement 
    austerity measures and to borrow heavily and later reschedule foreign debt 
    payments. After the end of hostilities in 1988, oil exports gradually 
    increased with the construction of new pipelines and restoration of damaged 
    facilities. Agricultural development remained hampered by labor shortages, 
    salinization, and dislocations caused by previous land reform and 
    collectivization programs. The industrial sector, although accorded high 
    priority by the government, also was under financial constraints. Iraq's 
    seizure of Kuwait in August 1990, subsequent international economic 
    embargoes, and military action by an international coalition beginning in 
    January 1991 drastically changed the economic picture. Industrial and 
    transportation facilities, which suffered severe damage, have been partially
 
    restored. Oil exports remain at less than 5% of the previous level. 


    Shortages of spare parts continue. Living standards deteriorated even 
    further in 1993 and 1994; consumer prices have more than doubled in both 
    1993 and 1994. The UN-sponsored economic embargo has reduced exports and 
    imports and has contributed to the sharp rise in prices. The Iraqi 
    government has been unwilling to abide by UN resolutions so that the 
    economic embargo can be removed. The government's policies of supporting 
    large military and internal security forces and of allocating resources to 
    key supporters of the regime have exacerbated shortages. In brief, per 
    capita output in 1993-94 is far below the 1989-90 level, but no precise 
    estimate is available.
