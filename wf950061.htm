                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Cote d'Ivoire is among the world's largest producers and exporters of 
    coffee, cocoa beans, and palm-kernel oil. Consequently, the economy is 
    highly sensitive to fluctuations in international prices for coffee and 
    cocoa and to weather conditions. Despite attempts by the government to 
    diversify, the economy is still largely dependent on agriculture and related
 
    industries. After several years of lagging performance, the Ivorian economy 
    began a comeback in 1994, due to improved prices for cocoa and coffee, 
    growth in non-traditional primary exports such as pineapples and rubber, 
    trade and banking liberalization, offshore oil and gas discoveries, and 
    generous external financing and debt rescheduling by multilateral lenders 
    and France. The 50% devaluation in January 1994 caused a one time jump in 
    the inflation rate. Government adherence to a renewed structural adjustment 
    program has led to a budget surplus for the first time in several years, a 
    smaller personnel budget, and an increase in public investment. While real 
    growth in 1994 was only 1.5%, the IMF and World Bank expect it will surpass 
    6% in 1995.
