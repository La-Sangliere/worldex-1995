                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    The economy is heavily dependent on the mining industry to extract and 
    process minerals for export. Mining accounts for almost 25% of GDP. Namibia 


    is the fourth-largest exporter of nonfuel minerals in Africa and the world's
 
    fifth-largest producer of uranium. Alluvial diamond deposits are among the 
    richest in the world, making Namibia a primary source for gem-quality 
    diamonds. Namibia also produces large quantities of lead, zinc, tin, silver,
 
    and tungsten. More than half the population depends on agriculture (largely 
    subsistence agriculture) for its livelihood. Namibia must import some of its
 
    food.
