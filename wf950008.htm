Title         :Antarctica 
Text          : 
                                   Antarctica 
 
                                    Geography 
 
Location: 
    continent mostly south of the Antarctic Circle 
Map references: 
    Antarctic Region 


Area: 
  total area: 
    14 million sq km (est.) 
  land area: 
    14 million sq km (est.) 
  comparative area: 
    slightly less than 1.5 times the size of the US 
  note: 
    second-smallest continent (after Australia) 
Land boundaries: 
    none, but see entry on International disputes 
Coastline: 
    17,968 km 
Maritime claims: 
    none, but see entry on International Disputes 
International disputes: 
    Antarctic Treaty defers claims (see Antarctic Treaty Summary below); 
    sections (some overlapping) claimed by Argentina, Australia, Chile, France 
    (Adelie Land), New Zealand (Ross Dependency), Norway (Queen Maud Land), and 
    UK; the US and most other nations do not recognize the territorial claims of
 
    other nations and have made no claims themselves (the US reserves the right 
    to do so); no formal claims have been made in the sector between 90 degrees 
    west and 150 degrees west 
Climate: 
    severe low temperatures vary with latitude, elevation, and distance from the
 
    ocean; East Antarctica is colder than West Antarctica because of its higher 
    elevation; Antarctic Peninsula has the most moderate climate; higher 
    temperatures occur in January along the coast and average slightly below 
    freezing 
Terrain: 
    about 98% thick continental ice sheet and 2% barren rock, with average 
    elevations between 2,000 and 4,000 meters; mountain ranges up to 4,897 
    meters high; ice-free coastal areas include parts of southern Victoria Land,
 
    Wilkes Land, the Antarctic Peninsula area, and parts of Ross Island on 
    McMurdo Sound; glaciers form ice shelves along about half of the coastline, 
    and floating ice shelves constitute 11% of the area of the continent 
Natural resources: 
    none presently exploited; iron ore, chromium, copper, gold, nickel, platinum
 
    and other minerals, and coal and hydrocarbons have been found in small, 
    uncommercial quantities 
Land use: 
  arable land: 
    0% 
  permanent crops: 
    0% 
  meadows and pastures: 
    0% 
  forest and woodland: 
    0% 
  other: 
    100% (ice 98%, barren rock 2%) 
Irrigated land: 
    0 sq km 
 
                                    Geography 
Environment: 


  current issues: 
    in October 1991 it was reported that the ozone shield, which protects the 
    Earth's surface from harmful ultraviolet radiation, had dwindled to the 
    lowest level recorded over Antarctica since 1975 when measurements were 
    first taken 
  natural hazards: 
    katabatic (gravity-driven) winds blow coastward from the high interior; 
    frequent blizzards form near the foot of the plateau; cyclonic storms form 
    over the ocean and move clockwise along the coast; volcanism on Deception 
    Island and isolated areas of West Antarctica; other seismic activity rare 
    and weak 
  international agreements: 
    NA 
Note: 
    the coldest, windiest, highest, and driest continent; during summer more 
    solar radiation reaches the surface at the South Pole than is received at 
    the Equator in an equivalent period; mostly uninhabitable 
 
                                     People 
 
Population: 
    no indigenous inhabitants; note - there are seasonally staffed research 
    stations

    doubt; stations may be subject to closings at any time because of ongoing 
    economic difficulties

  Antarctic Treaty Summary: 
    The Antarctic Treaty, signed on 1 December 1959 and entered into force on 23
 
    June 1961, establishes the legal framework for the management of Antarctica.
 
    Administration is carried out through consultative member meetings - the 
    18th Antarctic Treaty Consultative Meeting was in Japan in April 1993. 
    Currently, there are 42 treaty member nations: 26 consultative and 16 
    acceding. Consultative (voting) members include the seven nations that claim
 
    portions of Antarctica as national territory (some claims overlap) and 19 
    nonclaimant nations. The US and some other nations that have made no claims 
    have reserved the right to do so. The US does not recognize the claims of 
    others. The year in parentheses indicates when an acceding nation was voted 
    to full consultative (voting) status, while no date indicates the country 
    was an original 1959 treaty signatory. Claimant nations are - Argentina, 
    Australia, Chile, France, New Zealand, Norway, and the UK. Nonclaimant 
    consultative nations are - Belgium, Brazil (1983), China (1985), Ecuador 
    (1990), Finland (1989), Germany (1981), India (1983), Italy (1987), Japan, 
    South Korea (1989), Netherlands (1990), Peru (1989), Poland (1977), South 
    Africa, Spain (1988), Sweden (1988), Uruguay (1985), the US, and Russia. 
    Acceding (nonvoting) members, with year of accession in parentheses, are - 
    Austria (1987), Bulgaria (1978), Canada (1988), Colombia (1988), Cuba 
    (1984), Czech Republic (1993), Denmark (1965), Greece (1987), Guatemala 
    (1991), Hungary (1984), North Korea (1987), Papua New Guinea (1981), Romania
 
    (1971), Slovakia (1993), Switzerland (1990), and Ukraine (1992). 
  Article 1: 
    area to be used for peaceful purposes only; military activity, such as 
    weapons testing, is prohibited, but military personnel and equipment may be 
    used for scientific research or any other peaceful purpose 
  Article 2: 
    freedom of scientific investigation and cooperation shall continue 
  Article 3: 
    free exchange of information and personnel in cooperation with the UN and 
    other international agencies 
  Article 4: 
    does not recognize, dispute, or establish territorial claims and no new 
    claims shall be asserted while the treaty is in force 
  Article 5: 
    prohibits nuclear explosions or disposal of radioactive wastes 
  Article 6: 
    includes under the treaty all land and ice shelves south of 60 degrees 00 
    minutes south 
  Article 7: 
    treaty-state observers have free access, including aerial observation, to 
    any area and may inspect all stations, installations, and equipment; advance
 
    notice of all activities and of the introduction of military personnel must 
    be given 
  Article 8: 
    allows for jurisdiction over observers and scientists by their own states 
  Article 9: 
    frequent consultative meetings take place among member nations 
 
                                   Government 
  Article 10: 
    treaty states will discourage activities by any country in Antarctica that 
    are contrary to the treaty 
  Article 11: 


    disputes to be settled peacefully by the parties concerned or, ultimately, 
    by the ICJ 
  Articles 12, 13, 14: 
    deal with upholding, interpreting, and amending the treaty among involved 
    nations 
  Other agreements: 
    more than 170 recommendations adopted at treaty consultative meetings and 
    ratified by governments include - Agreed Measures for the Conservation of 
    Antarctic Fauna and Flora (1964); Convention for the Conservation of 
    Antarctic Seals (1972); Convention on the Conservation of Antarctic Marine 
    Living Resources (1980); a mineral resources agreement was signed in 1988 
    but was subsequently rejected; in 1991 the Protocol on Environmental 
    Protection to the Antarctic Treaty was signed and awaits ratification; this 
    agreement provides for the protection of the Antarctic environment through 
    five specific annexes on marine pollution, fauna, and flora, environmental 
    impact assessments, waste management, and protected areas; it also prohibits
 
    all activities relating to mineral resources except scientific research; 14 
    parties have ratified Protocol as of April 1995 
Legal system: 
    US law, including certain criminal offenses by or against US nationals, such
 
    as murder, may apply to areas not under jurisdiction of other countries. 
    Some US laws directly apply to Antarctica. For example, the Antarctic 
    Conservation Act, 16 U.S.C. section 2401 et seq., provides civil and 
    criminal penalties for the following activities, unless authorized by 
    regulation of statute: The taking of native mammals or birds; the 
    introduction of nonindigenous plants and animals; entry into specially 
    protected or scientific areas; the discharge or disposal of pollutants; and 
    the importation into the US of certain items from Antarctica. Violation of 
    the Antarctic Conservation Act carries penalties of up to $10,000 in fines 
    and 1 year in prison. The Departments of Treasury, Commerce, Transportation,
 
    and Interior share enforcement responsibilities. Public Law 95-541, the US 
    Antarctic Conservation Act of 1978, requires expeditions from the US to 
    Antarctica to notify, in advance, the Office of Oceans and Polar Affairs, 
    Room 5801, Department of State, Washington, DC 20520, which reports such 
    plans to other nations as required by the Antarctic Treaty. For more 
    information contact Permit Office, Office of Polar Programs, National 
    Science Foundation, Arlington, Virginia 22230 (703-306-1031). 
 
                                     Economy
