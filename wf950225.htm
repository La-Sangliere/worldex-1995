                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Sudan is buffeted by civil war, chronic political instability, adverse 
    weather, high inflation, a drop in remittances from abroad, and 
    counterproductive economic policies. Governmental entities account for more 
    than 70% of new investment. The private sector's main areas of activity are 
    agriculture and trading, with most private industrial investment predating 
    1980. Agriculture employs 80% of the work force. Industry mainly processes 
    agricultural items. Sluggish economic performance over the past decade, 
    attributable largely to declining annual rainfall, has reduced levels of per
 
    capita income and consumption. A large foreign debt and huge arrearages 
    continue to cause difficulties. In 1990 the International Monetary Fund took
 
    the unusual step of declaring Sudan noncooperative because of its nonpayment
 
    of arrearages to the Fund. After Sudan backtracked on promised reforms in 


    1992-93, the IMF threatened to expel Sudan from the Fund. To avoid 
    expulsion, Khartoum agreed to make payments on its arrears to the Fund, 
    liberalize exchange rates, and reduce subsidies. These measures have been 
    partially implemented. The government's continued prosecution of the civil 
    war and its growing international isolation led to a further deterioration 
    of the nonagricultural sectors of the economy during 1994. Agriculture, on 
    the other hand, after several disappointing years, enjoyed a bumper fall 
    harvest in 1994; its strong performance produced an overall growth rate in 
    GDP of perhaps 7%.
