Overview: 
    Kenya in recent years has had one of the highest natural rates of growth in 
    population, but the statistics have been complicated by the large-scale 
    movement of nomadic groups and of Somalis back and forth across the border. 
    Population growth has been accompanied by deforestation, deterioration in 
    the road system, the water supply, and other parts of the infrastructure. In
 
    industry and services, Nairobi's reluctance to embrace IMF-supported reforms
 
    had held back investment and growth in 1991-93. Nairobi's push on economic 
    reform in 1994, however, helped support a 3.3% increase in output.
