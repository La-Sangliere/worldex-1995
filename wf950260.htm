                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Agriculture employs more than half of the labor force, contributes 50% to 
    GDP, and furnishes 90% of exports. The bulk of export earnings comes from 
    the sale of coconut oil and copra. The economy depends on emigrant 
    remittances and foreign aid to support a level of imports much greater than 
    export earnings. Tourism has become the most important growth industry. The 
    economy continued to falter in 1994, as remittances and tourist earnings 
    remained low. Production of taro, the primary food export crop, has dropped 
    97% since a fungal disease struck the crop in 1993. The rapid growth in 1994
 
    of the giant African snail population in Western Samoa is also threatening 
    the country's basic food crops, such as bananas and coconuts.
