                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Vietnam has made significant progress in recent years moving away from the 
    planned economic model toward a more effective market-based economic system.
 
    Most prices are now fully decontrolled, and the Vietnamese currency has been
 
    effectively devalued and floated at world market rates. In addition, the 
    scope for private sector activity has been expanded, primarily through 
    decollectivization of the agricultural sector and introduction of laws 
    giving legal recognition to private business. Nearly three-quarters of 
    export earnings are generated by only two commodities, rice and crude oil. 
    Led by industry and construction, the economy did well in 1993 and 1994 with
 
    output rising 7% and 9% respectively. However, the industrial sector remains
 
    burdened by noncompetitive state-owned enterprises the government is 
    unwilling or unable to privatize. Unemployment looms as a serious problem 
    with roughly 20% of the work force without jobs and with population growth 
    swelling the ranks of the labor force yearly.
