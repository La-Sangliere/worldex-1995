    Kuwait which had been spelled out in Security Council Resolutions 687 
    (1991), 773 (1993), and 883 (1993); this formally ends earlier claims to

  natural hazards: 
    sudden cloudbursts are common from October to April, they bring inordinate

                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Kuwait is a small and relatively open economy with proved crude oil reserves
 
    of about 94 billion barrels - 10% of world reserves. Kuwait has rebuilt its 
    war-ravaged petroleum sector; its crude oil production reached at least 2.0 
    million barrels per day by the end of 1993. The government ran a sizable 
    fiscal deficit in 1993. Petroleum accounts for nearly half of GDP and 90% of
 
    export and government revenues. Kuwait lacks water and has practically no 
    arable land, thus preventing development of agriculture. With the exception 
    of fish, it depends almost wholly on food imports. About 75% of potable 
    water must be distilled or imported. Because of its high per capita income, 
    comparable with Western European incomes, Kuwait provides its citizens with 
    extensive health, educational, and retirement benefits. Per capita military 
    expenditures are among the highest in the world. The economy improved 
    moderately in 1994, with the growth in industry and finance, and should see 
    further gains in 1995, especially if oil prices go up. The World Bank has 
    urged Kuwait to push ahead with privatization, including in the oil 
    industry, but the government will move slowly on this front.
