                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Mali is among the poorest countries in the world, with 65% of its land area 
    desert or semidesert. Economic activity is largely confined to the riverine 
    area irrigated by the Niger. About 10% of the population is nomadic and some
 
    80% of the labor force is engaged in agriculture and fishing. Industrial 
    activity is concentrated on processing farm commodities. The economy is 
    beginning to turn around after contracting through 1992-93, largely because 
    of enhanced exports and import substitute production in the wake of the 50% 
    devaluation of January 1994. Post-devaluation inflation appears to have 
    peaked at 35% in 1994 and the government appears to be keeping on track with
 
    its IMF structural adjustment program.
