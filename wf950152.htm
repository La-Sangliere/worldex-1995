                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Significant resources are limestone, a favorable geographic location, and a 
    productive labor force. Malta produces only about 20% of its food needs, has
 
    limited freshwater supplies, and has no domestic energy sources. 
    Consequently, the economy is highly dependent on foreign trade and services.
 
    Manufacturing and tourism are the largest contributors to the economy. 
    Manufacturing accounts for about 24% of GDP, with the electronics and 
    textile industries major contributors and with the state-owned Malta 
    drydocks employing about 4,300 people. In 1994, over 1,000,000 tourists 
    visited the island. Per capita GDP of $10,760 places Malta in the range of 
    the less affluent EU countries.
