                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    The economy was formerly based on agriculture, mainly sheep farming, which 
    directly or indirectly employs most of the work force. Dairy farming 
    supports domestic consumption; crops furnish winter fodder. Exports feature 
    shipments of high-grade wool to the UK and the sale of postage stamps and 
    coins. Rich stocks of fish in the surrounding waters are not presently 
    exploited by the islanders. So far, efforts to establish a domestic fishing 
    industry have been unsuccessful. The economy has diversified since 1987 when
 
    the government began selling fishing licenses to foreign trawlers operating 
    within the Falklands exclusive fishing zone. These license fees total more 
    than $40 million per year and support the island's health, education, and 
    welfare system. To encourage tourism, the Falkland Islands Development 
    Corporation has built three lodges for visitors attracted by the abundant 
    wildlife and trout fishing. The islands are now self-financing except for 
    defense. The British Geological Survey announced a 200-mile oil exploration 
    zone around the islands in 1993 and early seismic surveys suggest 
    substantial reserves capable of producing 500,000 barrels per day.
