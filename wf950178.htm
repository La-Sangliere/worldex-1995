                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    The oil-rich Nigerian economy continues to be hobbled by political 
    instability and poor macroeconomic management. Nigeria's unpopular military 
    rulers show no sign of wanting to restore democratic civilian rule in the 
    near future and appear divided on how to redress fundamental economic 
    imbalances that cause troublesome inflation and the steady depreciation of 
    the naira. The government's domestic and international arrears continue to 


    limit economic growth - even in the oil sector - and prevent an agreement 
    with the IMF and bilateral creditors on debt relief. The inefficient 
    (largely subsistence) agricultural sector has failed to keep up with rapid 
    population growth, and Nigeria, once a large net exporter of food, now must 
    import food.
