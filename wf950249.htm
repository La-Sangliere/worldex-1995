    about half the size of Russia; about three-tenths the size of Africa; about 
    one-half the size of South America (or slightly larger than Brazil); 


    slightly smaller than China; about two and one-half times the size of 
    Western Europe

                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    The US has the most powerful, diverse, and technologically advanced economy 
    in the world, with a per capita GDP of $25,850, the largest among major 
    industrial nations. The economy is market oriented with most decisions made 
    by private individuals and business firms and with government purchases of 
    goods and services made predominantly in the marketplace. In 1989 the 
    economy enjoyed its seventh successive year of substantial growth, the 
    longest in peacetime history. The expansion featured moderation in wage and 
    consumer price increases and a steady reduction in unemployment to 5.2% of 
    the labor force. In 1990, however, growth slowed to 1% because of a 
    combination of factors, such as the worldwide increase in interest rates, 
    Iraq's invasion of Kuwait in August, the subsequent spurt in oil prices, and
 
    a general decline in business and consumer confidence. In 1991 output fell 
    by 0.6%, unemployment grew, and signs of recovery proved premature. Growth 
    picked up to 2.3% in 1992 and to 3.1% in 1993. Unemployment, however, 
    declined only gradually, the increase in GDP being mainly attributable to 
    gains in output per worker. The year 1994 witnessed a solid 4% gain in real 
    output, a low inflation rate of 2.6%, and a drop in unemployment below 6%. 
    The capture of both houses of Congress by the Republicans in the elections 
    of 8 November 1994 means substantial changes are likely in US economic 
    policy, including changes in the ways the US will address its major economic
 
    problems in 1995-96. These problems include inadequate investment in 
    economic infrastructure, rapidly rising medical costs of an aging 
    population, and sizable budget and trade deficits.
