                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Greece has a mixed capitalist economy with the basic entrepreneurial system 
    overlaid in 1981-89 by a socialist system that enlarged the public sector 
    from 55% of GDP in 1981 to about 70% in 1989. Since then, the public sector 
    has been reduced to about 60% of GDP. Tourism continues as a major source of
 
    foreign exchange, and agriculture is self-sufficient except for meat, dairy 
    products, and animal feedstuffs. Over the last decade, real GDP growth has 
    averaged 1.6% a year, compared with the European Union average of 2.2%. 
    Inflation continues to be well above the EU average, and the national debt 
    has reached 140% of GDP, the highest in the EU. Prime Minister PAPANDREOU 
    will probably make only limited progress correcting the economy's problems 
    of high inflation, large budget deficit, and decaying infrastructure. His 
    economic program suggests that although he will shun his expansionary 
    policies of the 1980s, he will avoid tough measures needed to slow inflation
 
    or reduce the state's role in the economy. He has limited the previous 
    government's privatization plans, for example, and has called for generous 
    welfare spending and real wage increases. Athens continues to rely heavily 
    on EU aid, which recently has amounted to about 6% of GDP. Greece almost 
    certainly will not meet the EU's Maastricht Treaty convergence targets of 
    public deficit held to 3% of GDP and national debt to 60% of GDP by 1999. 
    Per capita GDP has fallen below Portugal's level, the lowest among EU 
    members.
