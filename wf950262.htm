                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Whereas the northern city Sanaa is the political capital of a united Yemen, 
    the southern city Aden, with its refinery and port facilities, is the 
    economic and commercial capital. Future economic development depends heavily
 
    on Western-assisted development of the country's moderate oil resources. 
    Former South Yemen's willingness to merge stemmed partly from the steady 
    decline in Soviet economic support. The low level of domestic industry and 
    agriculture has made northern Yemen dependent on imports for practically all
 
    of its essential needs. Once self-sufficient in food production, northern 
    Yemen has become a major importer. Land once used for export crops - cotton,
 
    fruit, and vegetables - has been turned over to growing a shrub called qat, 


    whose leaves are chewed for their stimulant effect by Yemenis and which has 
    no significant export market. Economic growth in former South Yemen has been
 
    constrained by a lack of incentives, partly stemming from centralized 
    control over production decisions, investment allocation, and import 
    choices. Yemen's large trade deficits have been compensated for by 
    remittances from Yemenis working abroad and by foreign aid. Since the Gulf 
    crisis, remittances have dropped substantially. Growth in 1994-95 is 
    constrained by low oil prices, rapid inflation, and political deadlock that 
    are causing a lack of economic cooperation and leadership. However, a peace 
    agreement with Saudi Arabia in February 1995 and the expectation of a rise 
    in oil prices brighten Yemen's economic prospects.
