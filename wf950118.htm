Note: 
    The territories occupied by Israel since the 1967 war are not included in 
    the data below. In keeping with the framework established at the Madrid 
    Conference in October 1991, bilateral negotiations are being conducted 
    between Israel and Palestinian representatives, Syria, and Jordan to 
    determine the final status of the occupied territories. On 25 April 1982, 
    Israel withdrew from the Sinai pursuant to the 1979 Israel-Egypt Peace 
    treaty. Outstanding territorial and other disputes with Jordan were resolved
 
    in the 26 October 1994 Israel-Jordan Treaty of Peace.

                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Israel has a market economy with substantial government participation. It 
    depends on imports of crude oil, grains, raw materials, and military 
    equipment. Despite limited natural resources, Israel has intensively 
    developed its agricultural and industrial sectors over the past 20 years. 
    Industry employs about 22% of Israeli workers, construction 6.5%, 
    agriculture, forestry, and fishing 3.5%, and services most of the rest. 
    Israel is largely self-sufficient in food production except for grains. 
    Diamonds, high-technology equipment, and agricultural products (fruits and 
    vegetables) are leading exports. Israel usually posts current account 
    deficits, which are covered by large transfer payments from abroad and by 
    foreign loans. Roughly half of the government's external debt is owed to the
 
    United States, which is its major source of economic and military aid. To 
    earn needed foreign exchange, Israel has been targeting high-technology 
    niches in international markets, such as medical scanning equipment. The 
    influx of Jewish immigrants from the former USSR, which topped 450,000 
    during the period 1990-94, increased unemployment, intensified housing 
    problems, and strained the government budget. At the same time, the 
    immigrants bring to the economy valuable scientific and professional 
    expertise.
