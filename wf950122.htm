                                    Geography

                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    Government-industry cooperation, a strong work ethic, mastery of high 
    technology, and a comparatively small defense allocation (roughly 1% of GDP)
 
    have helped Japan advance with extraordinary rapidity to the rank of second 
    most powerful economy in the world. Industry, the most important sector of 
    the economy, is heavily dependent on imported raw materials and fuels. 
    Usually self-sufficient in rice, Japan must import about 50% of its 
    requirements of other grain and fodder crops. Japan maintains one of the 
    world's largest fishing fleets and accounts for nearly 15% of the global 
    catch. Overall economic growth has been spectacular: a 10% average in the 
    1960s, a 5% average in the 1970s and 1980s. Economic growth came to a halt 
    in 1992-93 largely because of contractionary domestic policies intended to 
    wring speculative excesses from the stock and real estate markets. Growth 
    resumed at a 0.6% pace in 1994 largely because of consumer demand. As for 
    foreign trade, the stronger yen and slower global growth are containing 
    export growth. Unemployment and inflation remain remarkably low in 
    comparison with the other industrialized nations. Japan continues to run a 
    huge trade surplus - $121 billion in 1994, roughly the same size as in 1993 
    - which supports extensive investment in foreign assets. Prime Minister 
    MURAYAMA has yet to formalize his government's plans for administrative and 
    economic reform, including reduction in the trade surplus. As leader of a 
    coalition government, he has softened his own socialist positions. The 
    crowding of the habitable land area and the aging of the population are two 
    major long-run problems.
