                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    The economy is heavily dependent on aid from New Zealand. Government 
    expenditures regularly exceed revenues, with the shortfall made up by grants
 
    from New Zealand - the grants are used to pay wages to public employees. The
 
    agricultural sector consists mainly of subsistence gardening, although some 
    cash crops are grown for export. Industry consists primarily of small 
    factories to process passion fruit, lime oil, honey, and coconut cream. The 
    sale of postage stamps to foreign collectors is an important source of 
    revenue. The island in recent years has suffered a serious loss of 
    population because of migration of Niueans to New Zealand.
