                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    The economy benefits substantially from financial assistance from the US. 
    The rate of funding has declined as locally generated government revenues 
    have grown. An agreement for the years 1986 to 1992 entitled the islands to 
    $228 million for capital development, government operations, and special 
    programs. A rapidly growing major source of income is the tourist industry, 
    which now employs about 50% of the work force. Japanese tourists 
    predominate. The agricultural sector is of minor importance and is made up 
    of cattle ranches and small farms producing coconuts, breadfruit, tomatoes, 
    and melons. Industry is small scale, mostly handicrafts, light 
    manufacturing, and garment production.
