                                     Economy 
 
Overview: 
    The Bulgarian economy continued its painful adjustment in 1994 from the 
    misdirected development undertaken during four decades of Communist rule. 
    Many aspects of a market economy have been put in place and have begun to 
    function, but much of the economy, especially the industrial sector, has yet
 
    to re-establish market links lost with the collapse of the other centrally 
    planned Soviet Bloc economies. The prices of many imported industrial 
    inputs, especially energy products, have risen markedly, and falling real 
    wages have not sufficed to restore competitiveness. The government plans 
    more extensive privatization in 1995 to improve the management of 
    enterprises and to encourage foreign investment. Bulgaria resumed payments 
    on its $10 billion in commercial debt in 1993 following the negotiation of a
 
    50% write-off.
